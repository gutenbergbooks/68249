  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LE ROI EST MORT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> first, the last—the only King the Americans ever
had, was dead. It was the 13th day of August, in the
year 1676. The human emotions of the Puritan people
of Massachusetts tugged at the shackles of a long repression
and broke them asunder, in the seemly town
of Plymouth. King Philip, the mighty Sachem of the
Wampanoag Indians, had been slain. His warriors
were scattered and slaughtered. His war was ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the streets of Plymouth poured a vast throng
of people. Men, women and children, they ran and
walked, surrounding a buff-colored army that filled the
thoroughfares like a turgid flood. This was the regiment
which Captain Benjamin Church had led to the
final camp of King Philip, in the swamps at Mt. Hope
and Pocasset, where the last scene in the sanguinary
drama had been enacted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was a troop of sixty horse, with officers. They
were well mounted, caparisoned with glittering back,
breast and headpiece, and armed with clanking sword,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>shouldered carbine, and great pistols, that flopped at
the waist. Behind them were foot-soldiers, brown
Puritans—stern, mirth-denying, lusty at fighting. Some
of these bore no weapon other than a pike. Another
frequently had upon him sword, pistol and carbine.
Above the heads of these men on foot waved a thin
forest of pike-staves, on the tips of which bright steel
threw back the dazzling rays of the sun. There was
clatter of scabbards on the pavement, thud and thud
of hoofs and feet in the roadway, and above all, shouts
of men and gabble of children.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were hordes on either side of this human flood,
pushing and crowding to gain the front of the column,
while a similar aggregation hung back upon the flank
of the regiment, hooting, craning necks and racing to
keep pace with the steady, long strides of the soldiers.
This division of interest was caused by the two counter
attractions of the pageant. Thus at the front, a red
Indian was leading the march with a wild, half-dancing
step, while he contorted his body weirdly for the purpose
of displaying to all beholders the ghastly proof of
victory—the head of the great King Philip. This Indian
ally might have stood for the mockery of a drum-major,
heading a march of doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spectators, racing, crowding, following, took a
crazed delight in beholding this gory head. Love,
anger, joy, the daily emotions of man, were habitually
so repressed by these serious people that now it seemed
as if they reveled as in an orgie of shuddering and
gasping, to give vent to their pent-up natures. They
laughed, they skipped on nimble feet, they sang praises.
The young men and women snatched the occasion, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>its looseness of deportment, to look unbridled feelings
into one another’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other attraction, in the rear, was a captive, a
mere boy, as white as any in the multitude, and paler
than the palest. Tall and lithe as he was, his age was
scarcely a whit above fourteen. He was dressed as an
Indian; he bore himself like a sullen brave. At his
side was old Annawon, the last of King Philip’s councilors,
who, having surrendered under a promise of
“good quarter” was even now being led to his execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interest centered, however, in the boy. Through
the stoicism which he labored to hold as a mask upon
his face, the signs of anguish played like an undercurrent.
In all the throng he had but a single friend,
the Red-man with whom he was marching. He looked
about at the pitiless embankment of faces. Near him
a score of nimble boys were running, a frantic desire to
strike him depicted in their eyes. Further away a tall
man was moving, perforce, with the tide. On his
shoulder he bore a little Puritan maiden, who might
have been crushed had he placed her on her feet. She
was looking at the boy-captive with eyes that seemed a
deeper brown for their very compassion. She clung
to the man who held her, with a tense little fist. Her
other tiny hand was pressed upon her cheek till all
about each small finger was white, in the bonny apple-blush
of her color. It seemed as if she must cry out to
the young prisoner, in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the boy was gazing back his answer to the
child—a quiver in consequence almost loosening his
lip—an urchin near him abruptly cast a stone that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>struck him smartly in the side. With a panther-like
motion the captive launched himself upon his assailant
and bore him to earth in a second. The old councillor,
Annawon, spoke some soft, quick word at which
the lad in buckskin immediately abandoned his overthrown
antagonist and regained his place in the march.
His eyes blinked swiftly, but in vain, for tears, of anger
and pain, forced their way between his lids and so to
his cheeks, when he dashed them swiftly away on his
sleeve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foot-soldiers scurried forward and closed in about
their dangerous charge. The bawling youths of Plymouth
seemed to multiply by magic. But their opportunities
for committing further mischief were presently
destroyed. The pageant was passing Plymouth jail.
An officer hustled ten of his men about the boy-prisoner
and wedged them through the press of people toward
this place of gloom. Above the clamor then rose a
voice, and in the Indian tongue the boy-captive heard
the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Farewell, Little-Standing-Panther.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was old Annawon, who had divined that there
would be no other parting with the lad, who was the
only creature which the war had left on earth for him
to love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy cried: “Farewell,” and the passage through
the people closed behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who looked beheld old Annawon smile faintly
and sadly. It was the only expression which had played
across his face since his surrender, and there was never
another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through nearly every street the glad procession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>wound. At length, the head of the butchered King
Philip was thrust upon an iron stake, which was planted
deeply in the ground. Governor Winslow then requested
that the people disperse to their several homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night at length came down—night the beneficent,
that cloaks the tokens of men’s barbarisms. Then
the moon arose, casting a pale, cold light, lest remorse
lose her way. What a passionless calm settled upon
the sleeping village!</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, with a tread as silent as that of death itself,
an active figure crept from shadow to shadow, in the
streets which the moon had silver-plated. The lone
human being came to the square wherein was planted
the stake with the moon-softened head upon it. The
visitor was the white boy-captive, dressed in his Indian
toggery. He had escaped from the jail.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the moonlight he came forward slowly. He halted
and extended his arms toward the stake with its motionless
burden. He approached in reverence, murmuring
brokenly in the Indian tongue:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Metacomet—Metacomet,——my foster-father,——I
have come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He knelt upon the ground and clasping the cold iron
stake in his arms, he sobbed and sobbed, as if his heart
would break.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A FRIENDSHIP OF CHANCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Through</span> the gray mist of Plymouth’s dawn there
came a sound of footsteps, and then a murmur of melodious
humming, somewhat controlled and yet too
sturdy and joyous to be readily accounted for in the
strict Puritan village. Presently, looming out of the
uncertain light, appeared the roughly-hewn figure of a
young man of five and twenty. He was singing to himself,
as he hastened with big strides through the
deserted streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the point of passing the place where the gibbeted
head of King Philip made a rude exclamation point in
the calm of gray Plymouth, the early riser suddenly
noted the curled-up form of a human being on the
ground, his arm loosely bent about the iron stake, his
head resting loosely against it, his eyes fast closed in
the sleep of exhaustion. The man started slightly,
halted and ceased his singing.</p>

<p class='c007'>He blinked his eyes for a moment, shifted his feet
uneasily and rubbed stoutly at his jaw, as he gazed in
perplexity at the picture before him. He then tip-toed
as if to go on, quietly, about his own business. He
glanced at the head, then back to the boy, from
whose lips, in his sleep, a little moan escaped. The
visitor noted the traces where tears had channeled down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the lad’s pale cheeks. There was something unescapable
in the attitude of the bare golden head against the
stake. The man stopped and laid his big hand gently
on the half-curled locks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly the boy awoke, leaped to his feet and fell
down again, from sheer stiffness, staring at the man
with eyes somewhat wild. He arose again at once,
more steadily, overcoming the cramps in his muscles
doggedly, never ceasing for a second to watch the man
who had waked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I give you good morrow,” said the man. “It
seems to me you have need of a friend, since you have
clearly lost one that you much esteemed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was persuasion and honesty in the stranger’s
warm-blue eyes, good nature in his broad, smooth face
and a large capacity for affection denoted in his somewhat
sensuous mouth. Such a look of friendship and
utter sincerity as he bestowed on the startled and defiant
boy before him could not have been easily counterfeited.
The youthful know sincerity by intuition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you?” said the boy, his voice hoarse and
weakened. “What would anybody want with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is William Phipps,” said the stranger,
simply. “I am a ship-builder of Boston. If you have
no better friend, perhaps I would do till you can find
one. I am on my way to Boston now. If you need a
friend and would like to leave Plymouth, you may come
with me, unless you feel you cannot trust any one about
this village.” He paused a moment and then added,
“I think you must be the boy I heard of, Adam Rust,
brought in with the captured Indians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Adam Rust,” the boy admitted. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>have no friends left. If you have been helping to kill
the Wampanoags I would rather not try to be your
friend. But I know I would like you and I should be
glad to go to Boston, or any place away from here.” In
the daylight he could not bear to look up at the head
above him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been too busy to fight,” said William Phipps,
employing the same excuse he had used for friends with
recruiting proclivities. “And I have been too happy,”
he added, as if involuntarily. “So, you see, there is
no reason why I should not be your friend. Have you
had any breakfast?” He put out his hand to shake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Adam. He lost his hand in the big fist
which Phipps presented, and restrained himself from
crying by making a mighty effort. He had gone without
eating for two days, but he said nothing about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then,” said Phipps heartily, “the sooner we start
the better. We can get something hot on the brig.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He began his long striding again. Adam hesitated a
moment. He looked up at the features above him, his
heart gushing full of emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some inarticulate farewell, in the Indian tongue, he
breathed through his quivering lips. His eyes grew
dimmed. He fancied he saw a smile of farewell and of
encouragement play intangibly on those still, saddened
lineaments, and so he held forth his arms for a second
and then turned away to join his new-found protector.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps, having thought the boy to be following
more closely than he was, stopped to let him catch
up. Thus he noted the look of anguish with which the
lad was leaving that grim remnant of King Philip
behind. Phipps was one of Nature’s “motherly men”—hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>ever more numerous than rocs’ eggs on the
earth. He felt his heart go forth to Adam Rust. Therefore
it was that he looked down in the boy’s face, time
after time, as they walked along together. Thus they
came to the water-front and wharves, at the end of one
of which the brig “Captain Spencer” was swinging.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This ship belongs to me and I made her,” said
Phipps, with candid pride in his achievement. “You
shall see that she sails right merrily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went aboard. A few sailors scrubbing down
the deck, barefooted and with sleeves at elbow, now
abandoned their task temporarily, at the command of
the mate, who had seen his captain coming, to hoist
sail and let go the hawsers. The chuckle in the blocks,
as the sailors heaved and hauled at the ropes, gave
Adam Rust a pleasure he had never before experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfast being not yet prepared for service, Phipps
conducted his foundling about the craft for a look at
her beauties. When Adam had putted the muzzle of
the brig’s gun and felt the weight of a naked sword in
his fist, in the armory, the buoyancy of his youth put
new color in his cheeks and a sparkle in his eyes. He
was a bright-natural, companionable lad, who grew
friendly and smiled his way into one’s affections rapidly,
but naturally. When he and Phipps had come up
again to the deck, after breakfast, they felt as if they
had always been friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brig was under way. Shorewards the gray old
Atlantic was wrinkled under the fretful annoyance of a
brisk, salty breeze. The ship was slipping prettily up
the coast, with stately courtesies to the stern rocks that
stood like guardians to the land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I think we shall find you were born for a sailor,
Adam,” said the master of the craft. “I can give you
my word it is more joy and life to sail a ship than to
make one. And some day——” but he halted. The
modest boasts, with which he warmed the heart of his
well-beloved wife, were a bit too sacred for repetition,
even to a boy so winning. “But,” he concluded, “perhaps
you would like to tell me something of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus encouraged Adam related his story. He was
the son of John Rust, a chivalrous gentleman, an affectionate
husband and a serious man, with a light heart
and a ready wit. John Rust had been the friend of the
Indians and the mediator between them and the whites
until the sheer perfidy of the Puritans had rendered him
hopeless of retaining the confidence of the Red men,
when he had abandoned the office. Adam’s mother had
been dead for something more than four years. Afflicted
by his sense of loss, John Rust had become a
strange man, a restless soul hopelessly searching for
that other self, as knights of old once sought the holy
grail.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went forth alone into the trackless wilderness
that led endlessly into the west. Although the father
and son had been knit together in their affections by
long talks, long ranges together in the forests and by
the lessons which the man had imparted, yet when John
Rust had gone on his unearthly quest, he could not
bear the thought of taking young Adam with him into
the wilds.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had therefore left the boy with his friends, the
lad’s natural guardians, the honorable nation of Wampanoags.
“Keep him here, teach him of your wisdom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>make him one of your young warriors,” he had said when
he went, “so that when I return I may know him for
his worth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>King Philip, the mighty Sachem of the tribe, had
thereafter been as a foster-father to the boy. For more
than two years the Red-man had believed John Rust to
have found his final lodge, and this was the truth. And
perhaps he had also found his holy grail. He perished
alone in the trackless forest. Adam had learned his
wood-lore of his red brothers. He was stout, lithe,
wiry and nimble. He rode a horse like the torso of a
centaur. He was a bit of a boaster, in a frank and
healthy way.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Philip’s war, ascribed, as to causes, to “the
passion of the English for territory; their confidence
that God had opened up America for their exclusive
occupancy; their contempt for the Indians and their
utter disregard for their rights,” had come inexorably
upon the Wampanoags. In its vortex of action, movement,
success and failure at last for the Indians, Adam
Rust had been whirled along with Metacomet. He had
never been permitted by King Philip to fight against
his “white brothers,” but he had assisted to plan for the
safety of the old men, women and children, in procuring
game and in constructing shelters. He had learned
to love these silently suffering people with all his heart.
The fights, the hardships, the doom, coming inevitably
upon the hopeless Wampanoags, had made the boy a
man, in some of the innermost recesses of a heart’s
suffering. He had seen the last sad remnants of the
Wampanoags, the Pocassets and the Narragansetts
scatter, to perish in the dismal swamps. He had witnessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the death of King Philip, brought upon him by
a treacherous fellow Red-man. And then he had
marched in that grim procession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam made no attempt to convey an idea of the magnitude
of his loss. It would not have been possible.
There is something in human nature which can never
be convinced that death has utterly stilled a beloved
voice and quenched the fire of the soul showing through
a pair of eyes endeared by companionship. This in
Adam made him feel, even as he told his tale to William
Phipps, that he was somehow deserting his faithful
friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bareheaded on the sun-lit deck as he told his story,
lithe in his gestures, splendidly scornful when he imitated
the great chieftains of the tribes, and then like
a young Viking as at last he finished his narrative and
looked far and wide on the sparkling sea, in joyousness
at the newer chapter which seemed to open to the very
horizons themselves before him, Adam awakened the
lusty youth and daring in William Phipps and the
dreams of a world’s career always present in his brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man’s eyes sparkled, as he spun the wheel that
guided the brig, bounding beneath their feet. A restlessness
seized upon the spirit in his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” he said, “do you like this ship?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes!—oh, it makes me feel like shouting!” the boy
exclaimed. “I wish I could straddle it, like a horse,
and make it go faster and wilder, ’way off there—and
everywhere! Oh, don’t it make you breathe!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then,” said Phipps, repressing his own love of such
a madness as Adam had voiced, “let us go for a long sail
together. I have long had in mind a voyage for trading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to Hispaniola. If you would like to go with me,
I will get the brig ready in a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For his answer young Adam leaped as if he would
spur the ship in the ribs and ride her to the end of the
earth forthwith.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE GERM OF A PASSION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>A bonnie</span> little Puritan maid, Mistress Garde Merrill,
stood in the open doorway at her home, fervently
hugging her kitten. The sunlight seemed almost like
beaten gold, so tangibly did it lay upon the house, the
vines that climbed the wall, and the garden full of old-fashioned
flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few leaves, which had escaped from the trees, in a
longing to extend their field of romping, were being
whirled about in a brisk zephyr that spun in a corner.
A sense of warmth and fragrance made all the world
seem wantoning in its own loveliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Garde, watching the frolic of the leaves, and
thinking them pretty elves and fairies, dancing, presently
looked up into the solemn visage of a passing
citizen, who had paused at the gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mistress Merrill,” he said, gravely, after a moment’s
inspection of the bright, enchanting little face, “your
eyes have not the Puritan spirit of meekness.” Thereupon
he departed on his way, sadly shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde’s eyes, in all truth, were dancing right joyously;
and dancing was not accounted a Puritan devotion.
Such brown, light-ensnaring eyes could not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>however, constrain themselves to melancholy. No
more could the apple-red of her smooth, round cheeks
retreat from the ardor of the sun. As for her hair, like
strands on strands of spun mahogany, no power on
earth could have disentangled its nets wherein the rays
of golden light had meshed and intermeshed themselves.
In her brightness of color, with her black and
white kitten on her arm, the child was a dainty little
human jewel.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was watching a bee and a butterfly when a shadow
fell again into the yard, among the flowers, at the entrance.
Garde felt her attention drawn and centered
at once. She found herself looking not so much at a
bareheaded boy, as fairly into the depths of his very
blue and steadfast eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visitor stood there with his hands clasping two
of the pickets of which the gate was fashioned. He had
seen everything in the garden at one glance, but he was
looking at Garde. His eyes began laughingly, then
seriously, but always frankly, to ask a favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I prithee come in,” said Garde, as one a little struck
with wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy came in. Garde met him in the path and
gave him her kitten. He took it, apparently because
she gave it, and not because he was inordinately fond
of cats. It seemed to Garde that she knew this boy,
and yet he had on a suit that suggested a young sailor,
and she had never made the acquaintance of any sailors
whatsoever. If he would only look elsewhere than
at her face, she thought, perhaps she could remember.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See them,” she said, and she pointed to where the
leaves were once more capering in the corner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The boy looked, but his gaze would swing back to its
North, which it found in two brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw you that day in Plymouth,” he said. “And
I got out of their old jail, and I didn’t see anybody else
that looked kind or nice among all those people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” said Garde, suddenly remembering everything,
“oh, you were—that boy marching with the
old Indian. I was so sorry. And I am so glad that you
got away. I am real glad you came to see me. Grandfather
and I were down there for a visit—so I saw you.
Oh dear me!” She looked at her young visitor with
eyes open wide by amazement. It seemed almost too
much to believe that the very boy she had seen and so
pitied and liked, in that terrible procession at Plymouth,
should actually be standing here before her in her
grandfather’s garden! “Oh dear me!” she presently
said again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hate Plymouth!” said the boy, “but I like
Boston.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so glad,” said Garde. “Will you tell me your
name? Mine is Garde Merrill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy said: “My name is Adam Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was named for all my aunts,” the maid imparted,
as if eager to set a troublesome matter straight at once,
“Gertrude, Abigail, Rosella, Dorothy and Elizabeth.
The first letters of their names spell G-A-R-D-E,
Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her visitor was rendered speechless for a moment.
“Metacomet and all the Indians used to call me Little-Standing-Panther,”
he then said, boyishly, not to be
outdone in the matter of names.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Metacomet—King Philip? Oh, then you are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>boy that used to live with the Indians, and that was
how they got you!” gasped the little maid. “Grandfather
told auntie all about it. Oh, I wish I could live
with the Indians! I am very, very sorry they got you!
But I am glad you came to see me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam flushed with innocent and modest pride, thus
to impress his small admirer, who was named so
formidably. He thought that nothing so pleasant
had ever happened in all his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is too sad to live with Indians,” he answered.
A mist seemed to obscure the light in his eyes and
to cast a shadow between them and the sweet face at
which he was looking with frank admiration. The
cloud passed, however, as clouds will in the summer,
and his gaze was again one of illuminated smiles. “I
am a sailor now,” he said, with a little boast in his
voice. “To-morrow morning we are going to start for
Hispaniola.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear me!” said Garde, in sheer despair of an
adequate expression of her many emotions. Then she
added contritely: “I mustn’t say ‘Oh dear me!’ but—oh
dear—I wish I might.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shan’t mind,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I could go to Hispaniola, too,” said Garde,
honestly. “I hate to be kept here as quiet as a clock
that doesn’t go. I suppose you couldn’t take me? Let’s
sit down with the kitten and think it over together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think we could take any girls,” said Adam,
seating himself at her side on the porch, “but I could
bring you back something when I come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let’s talk all about what we would rather have
most,” Garde responded.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>So their fingers mingled in the fur of the kitten and
they talked of fabulous things with which the West
Indies were reported to abound. His golden hair, and
her hair so darkly red, made the picture in the sunlight
a thing complete in its brightness and beauty. The
wind floated a few stray filaments, richly red as mahogany,
from the masses on Garde’s pretty brow, across to
the ringlets on Adam’s temple. To and fro, over these
delicate copper wires, stretched for its purpose, the
sweet love that comes first to a lad and a maid, danced
with electrical activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are going to-morrow,” said Garde, “you
must see all the flowers and everything now.” She therefore
took him by the hand and led him about the garden,
first she, then he, and then she once
more carrying the kitten.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were still in the midst of their explorations of
the garden, which required that each part should be
visited several times, when the gate opened and in
walked Garde’s tall, stern-looking grandfather.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner rubbed his eyes in amazement, hardly
believing that his senses could actually be recording a
picture of his granddaughter, hand in hand with some
utter stranger of a boy, in his own precincts. He came
quickly toward the pair, making a sound that came
within an ell of being a shout.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde looked up in sudden affright. Adam regarded
the visitor calmly and without emotion. Having first
dropped the young sailor’s hand, Garde now resolutely
screwed her little warm fingers back into the boy’s fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grandfather,” she said boldly, “I shall sail to-morrow
for Hispaniola.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>David Donner, at this, was so suddenly filled with
steam pressure, which he felt constrained to repress,
that his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go away, boy,” he said to Adam. “Mistress Merrill,
your conduct is quite uncalled for.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having divined that his sister had deserted her post
and gone, as was her wont, to the nearest neighbor’s,
for a snack of gossip, he glared at Adam, swooped down
upon Garde and caught her up in his arms abruptly,
kitten and all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her hold on Adam’s hand being rudely wrenched
asunder, Garde felt her heart break incontinently. She
began to weep without restraint, in fact, furiously. She
also kicked, and was also deporting herself when the
door was slammed behind the forms of herself, her kitten
and her grandfather, a moment later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked once where she had gone. His face had
assumed a stolidity which he was far from feeling. He
walked to the gate and went away, without once turning
to look back at the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mistress Garde, confronted by David Donner at close
quarters, soon regained her maidenly composure and
wept surreptitiously on the stomach of the kitten. At
length she looked up in defiance at the silent old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have changed the name of my kitten,” she said.
“His name is Little-Standing-Panther!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her grandfather, to whom this outbreak seemed
something of an indication of mental disorder, on her
part, stared at the child dumbly. Not without some
justification for her deductions, Garde thought him
quelled. In a spirit of reckless defiance, and likewise
to give some vent to her feelings, she suddenly threw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her arms about the bedewed kitten, on its pillow,
pressed her face against its fur and said to it, fervently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little-Standing-Panther, I love you, and love you
and love you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grandfather Donner looked up in alarm. “Tut, tut,
my child,” said he, “love is a passion.”</p>

      <div class='line in2'>In his thews and in his sword!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Toward</span> the close of a glorious day in September,
1683, William Phipps beheld a smart brig nose her way
up the harbor of Boston, and drop in her anchor in the
field of water wherein his ship-yard thrust its toes. A
small boat then presently put forth and made straight
for the ship-yard landing, where three men calmly
alighted, throwing ashore a small heap of shabby-genteel-looking
baggage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat annoyed, thus to have his precincts employed
by any Tom, Dick and Harry of chance, Phipps
stepped from between the ribs of a ship’s skeleton,
which was being daily articulated, and strode toward
the intruders. Then a rumble, which ought to have
been a shout, broke from his lips, about the same second
that a roar of joy appeared to leap out of the foremost
of the strangers, who had landed and who were coming
boldly forward.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>William Phipps and the leader of the invading trio
then rushed hotly together and collided, giving each
other a bear-like hug from which the ship-builder presently
extricated himself at a thought of how he might
be shocking all or any good Puritans who might chance
to be witnessing the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, shatter my hilt! and God bless you! if it
isn’t your same old beloved self!” said the stranger,
heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My boy! Bless your eyes, Adam, I never thought
to see you again!” said bluff William Phipps. “You
big young rascal! You full-rigged ship! Where have
you come from? What do you mean by making me swear
myself into purgatory at your carelessness in getting
yourself killed? You twenty-gun frigate—you—you
big——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He left off for very constraint, for his throat blocked
up, despite his most heroic efforts. He and Adam
Rust began to roar with laughter, the tears in their
eyes needing some excuse. Meantime the two companions
who had come with the young rover, stood
gazing about them, in patience, and likewise looking
in wonder on the two men before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was reason enough to look, for Adam and
Phipps were a pair to command attention. It seemed
as if a founder had used the big ship-builder as a pattern
on which to refine his art in casting the younger
man. Adam’s back was a trifle narrower; his chest
was a bit wider; he was trimmer at the waist, neater
at the thigh, longer-armed. His hands were smaller,
just as his movements were quicker and lighter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Adam’s hair crowned him with tawny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>ringlets of gold, while that of Phipps was browner, and
though the young fellow wore a small mustache, in
contrast, to the smooth-shaved face of his friend, it
might yet be said that the two men looked alike. Both
were bronzed by weather, both had steadfast eyes with
the same frank expression, the same blue tint and the
same integrity about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their dress the two men differed. William Phipps,
whatsoever he might indulge himself in doing when
away on the sea, conformed to the dark-brown simplicity
of the Puritans when in Boston. Adam, on the
other hand, wore a brown velvet coat which, though
at present somewhat faded and moulting, had once been
fine feathers in England. His waistcoat had been of
royal purple, before its nap fled before the onslaughts
of the clothes-brush, while his breeches were of a
time-tanned forest green which disappeared into the maw
of his wide-topped leather boots. He wore at his hip
a veteran blade of steel, in a scabbard as battered as
the outer gate of a stronghold. When not in his fighting
fist, the hilt of this weapon contented itself with
caresses from his softer hand, the left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two men having shaken hands for the third time,
and having looked each other over from head to foot,
and laughed and asked each other a dozen questions, to
which neither had returned any answers, Adam suddenly
remembered his comrades, waiting in the background.
He turned to them now, not without affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Pike and Halberd,” he said, “you must meet
my third father, Captain William Phipps, a noble man
to whom you will owe allegiance all your miserable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>lives. William, these are my beef-eaters. Don’t ask
me where I got them. They are neither out of jail nor
heaven. But they have let me save their lives and feed
them and clothe them, and they are valiant, faithful
rascals. To know them is to love them, and not to
know them is to be snubbed by Satan. They have been
my double shadow for a year, sharing my prosperous
condition like two peers of the realm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters grinned as they exchanged salutations
with Phipps. Pike was a short individual, inclined
to be fat, even when on the slimmest of rations.
The pupils of his eyes were like two suns that had risen
above the horizon of his lower lids, only to obscure
themselves under the cloud-like lids above. Their expression,
especially when he gazed upward into Adam’s
face, was something too appealingly saint-like and
beseeching for anything mortal to possess. Halberd was
a ladder of a man up which everything, save success,
had clambered to paint expressions on his face, which
was grave and melancholy to the verge of the ludicrous.
He had two little bunches of muscle, each of which
stuck out like half a walnut, at the corners of his jaws,
where they had grown and developed as a result of his
clamping his molars together, in a determination to do
or to be something which had, apparently, never as
yet transpired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two looked about as much like beef-eaters as
a mouse looks like a man-eater. They were ragged,
where not fantastic, in their apparel; they were obviously
fitter for a feast than a fight, for the sea had
depleted both of their hoardings of vigor and courage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” said Halberd, theatrically, “we have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>nothing but good reports of you for a year.” Whether
he placed his hand on his heart or his stomach, as he
said this, and what he meant to convey as his meaning,
could never be wholly clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall be honored to fight for you, if need arise,”
said Pike, who panted somewhat, on all occasions,
“while there is a breath in our bodies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a privilege to know you both,” said Phipps,
whose gravity was as dry as tinder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any friend of the Sachem’s is a friend of ours,”
responded Halberd. He said this grandly and made a
profound bow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ‘Sachem’?” repeated Phipps, and he looked
at Adam, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had the grace to blush a trifle, thus to be
caught in one of the harmless little boasts in which he
had indulged himself, over sea. “Just a foolish habit
the two have gotten into,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” said William Phipps. “Well, then, Sachem,
it will soon be growing dark, you had best come home
with me to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Involuntarily Adam turned about to look at the beef-eaters.
Their eyes had abruptly taken on a preternatural
brightness at the word dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have much to ask you and much to tell you,”
Phipps added. “And the goodwife would exact this
honor if she knew you were come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The invitation did not include Adam’s retinue. He
swallowed, as if the delicious odors of one of Goodwife
Phipp’s dinners were about to escape him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” he said, “the honors are all the other way
about, but—the fact is—a previous engagement—I—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>have promised a rousing hot din—I have accepted
an invitation to dine with the beef-eaters, at the Crow
and Arrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship-builder knew all about those “rousing hot
dinners” of cold eel-pie, potatoes and mustard, for which
the Crow and Arrow tavern was not exactly famous.
He looked at Adam, to whom as their sachem the
beef-eaters appealed with their eyes, like two faithful
animals. Adam was regarding the pair silently, a faint
smile of cheer and camaraderie on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but my invitation included our friends,”
Phipps hastened to say. “Come, come, the tavern
can wait till to-morrow. Gentlemen, you will certainly
not disappoint me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis well spoken that the tavern can wait,” said
Pike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To disappoint the friend of the Sachem would be a
grievous thing,” said Halberd. “Let the galled tavern
sweat with impatience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They would all have started away together at once,
had not Phipps noted the heap of baggage, left untidily
upon his landing when the travelers arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said he, “Adam, you know the way to the
house, suppose you and your friends carry your worldly
goods to the tavern, engage your apartments, and then
follow me on. I, in the meantime, can hasten home
to apprise the wife that you are coming, with the
beef-eaters, and she can therefore make due preparations
in honor of the event.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is good sense,” said Adam. “Go along, or we
shall be there before you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps, with a half dozen backward looks at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>guests and their shabby chattels, made his way out of
the ship-yard without further delay. Adam and his
retinue gripped three or four parcels apiece and started,
with clank of sword, and in some discomfort, for the
Crow and Arrow.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>AN UNGODLY PERFORMANCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam Rust</span> knew the Crow and Arrow more by that
repute which had traveled back to England, through
the medium of young stalwarts and sailors, than he did
from personal acquaintance with its charms. He had
seen the place frequently enough, when first he came
to Boston with William Phipps, but the town had expanded
much since then and bore an air of unfamiliarity.
The young man and his beef-eaters therefore
wandered somewhat from their course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being overladen and dressed out of the ordinary
fashion, the trio soon found themselves attracting
attention, particularly from certain of the youths of
the quarter and the rough characters incidental to
shipping and the neighborhood thereof. Adam was
carrying a long box, somewhat decrepit with age. It
swung against his legs and struck an occasional post,
or a corner, held insecurely as it was by his little finger
only, which was passed through a brass handle. In
this manner, and with a growing cluster of curious
persons beginning to follow on behind, the party were
in sight of the tavern at last, when this long box of
Adam’s abruptly opened and spilled out a richly darkened
old violin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>With a short exclamation of impatience, Adam halted
and dropped his other bundles. Over these tall Halberd
fell, with a great clatter of weapons, tin box and shaken
bones. Adam fended him off from the violin, snatched
it up and scrutinized it with the eager concern which a
mother might bestow upon a delicate child. He found
it uninjured, but, as it might have been smashed, he
clung to it fondly, reluctant to place it again in its
treacherous case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally the downfall of Halberd had delighted the
gamin and the sailors following. These formed a
cluster about the party, and their numbers drew additional
spectators rapidly. A number of seafaring men
shoved stoutly forward, their eyes glistening at sight
of the musical instrument.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say, give us something, then, on that there red
boy!” demanded one of the men, as healthy a looking
rascal as ever drew breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look a bonny lad, come on—there’s a good
un,” said another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rattle her guts,” said a third. “We ain’t heard
the like of a fiddle since we came to this town of
preachers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked quietly about him. He knew most of
the fellows about in the rude circle for rough English
rovers who would love him if he played, or knock him
and his belongings playfully into the street if he refused.
He was not accustomed to churlishness; moreover, he
felt particularly in the mood for playing. The ruddy
sunset, the warm breath of the passing day, the very
taste of American air, seemed lusty and joyous, despite
the rigid Puritanical spirit of the mirth-denying people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of the colony. He took up the bow, twanged the
strings, tightened two that had become laggard, and
jumped into the middle of a rollicking composition that
seemed to bubble up out of the body of the violin and
tumble off into the crowd in a species of mad delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had the instrument been a spirit of wine, richly dark
red as old port, and rendered alive by the frolicking
bow, it could not have thrown off more merry snatches
of melody’s mirth. It chuckled, it caught its breath,
like a fat old monk at his laughing, it broke out in
guffaws of hilarity, till not a soul in the audience
could keep his feet seemly beneath him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sailors danced, boldly, though clumsily. Their
faces beamed with innocent drunkenness, for drunk they
were, with what seemed like the fumes and taste of
this wine of sound. They had been denied it so long
that it went to their heads at the first draught.</p>

<p class='c007'>Across the street, issuing quietly and, he hoped, unobserved,
from a door that led into the tavern, a Puritan
father now appeared, wiping his mouth as a man has
no occasion for doing unless he had recently dipped his
upper lip into a mug. He suddenly halted, at the
sound of music from over the way. He frowned at the
now somewhat dense assemblage of boys and citizens
surrounding Adam Rust, and worked up a mask of
severity on his face from which it had been temporarily
absent. He opened his mouth, as if to speak, and then,
realizing that he might not be heard at this distance
from them, moved a rod toward his fellow-beings and
took a stand in the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment an ominous snap resounded above
both the playing and its accompaniment of scuffling feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and gruff explosions of enjoyment and hearty appreciation.
Instantly Adam ceased playing. He had felt a
string writhe beneath his fingers. The man in the roadway
grasped at the moment instantly, to raise his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Begone, disperse, you vagabonds!” he said.
“What is the meaning of this ungodly performance?
Disperse, I say, you are bedeviled by this shameless
disciple of Satan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, intent on his violin, which he found had not
broken but had merely slipped a string, heard this
tirade, naturally, as did all the others. A few boys
sneaked immediately about the cluster of men and
sped away, as if from some terrible wrath to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is yon sufferer for melancholy?” said Adam,
looking carelessly at the would-be interrupter. Then
suddenly a gleam came into his eye, as he recognized in
the man one of the harsh hypocrites who had been
among the few zealots who had imprisoned him, years
before. “Halberd,” he added, “fetch the gentleman
forward. Methinks he fain would dance and make
merry among us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His opening question had been hailed with snorts of
amusement; his proposal ignited all the roguishness in
the crowd. Halberd, nothing loth to add his quota to
the general fun, strode forward at once, way being made
by the admiring throng, and he bowed profoundly before
the bridling admonisher in the street. Then without
warning, he scampered nimbly to the rear of the man of
severity, took him by the collar and the slack of his
knickerbockers and hustled him precipitately into the
gathering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam began to play at once. The spectators gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>about the astonished and indignant person of severity,
thirsty for fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You evidently wanted to dance, therefore by all
means commence,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a veritable limb of Satan!” said the man.
“You shall be reported for this unseemly——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halberd,” interrupted Adam, “the gentleman is
as shy and timid as your veriest girl. Could you not
persuade him to dance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was born for persuasion,” said Halberd. Thereupon
he drew from his belt a pistol, most formidable,
whether loaded or not, and pushed its metal lips against
the neck of the hedged-in Puritan, whom he continued
to restrain by the collar. “Make merry for this
goodly company by doing a few dainty steps,” he
requested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crowd pushed in closer and roared with delight.
Some one among them knocked the reluctant dancer’s
knees forward. He almost fell down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s beginning!” cried Adam, and he went for his
fiddle with the bow as if he were fencing with a dozen
pirates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dance!” commanded Halberd, “dance!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terpsichore’s victim was not a man of sand. Drops
of perspiration oozed out on his forehead. A look of
abject fear drove the mask of severity from his face.
He jumped up and down ridiculously, his knees knocking
together for his castanets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faster!” cried Adam, fiddling like a madman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faster!” echoed Halberd, with his pistol-muzzle
nosing in the dancer’s ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man jumped higher, but not faster; he was too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>weakened by cowardice. The sailors joined in. They
could not keep their feet on the ground. The contagion
spread. Pike and Halberd joined the hopping.
The offending admonisher looked about at them in
a frenzy of despair, afraid of who might be witnessing
his exhibition. He was a sorry dancer, for he was so
eager to please that he flopped his arms deliriously, as
if to convince his beholders of his willingness to make
himself as entertaining as possible. When he suddenly
collapsed and fell down, Adam ceased playing. The
crowd settled on the pavement and applauded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For shame, good friend,” said Adam, solemnly,
“now that I observe your garb, I am shocked and
amazed at your conduct. Friends, let us go to the tavern
and report this gentleman’s unseemly behavior. In
payment for the fiddling, you may fetch my bales of
goods and merchandise.” He waved to his shabby baggage
and led the way to the Crow and Arrow, which
had long before disgorged nearly all of its company, and
its landlord, to add to the audience in the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flinging up his only piece of gold, the young rover
ordered refreshment for all who crowded into the
tavern, and while they were drinking, he dragged the
beef-eaters, with all the “bales of merchandise,” away
to the meager apartments provided above stairs in the
sorry hostelry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the darkness of the hall, he ran heavily against
some one who was just on the point of quitting a room.
The innocent person was bowled endways.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confound your impudence!” said the voice
of a man. “Why don’t you look where you are
going?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“I couldn’t see for fools in the way,” retorted Adam.
“I am no king, requiring you to fall before me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t see your face, but I can see that you are an
arrant knave,” said the other hotly. “You never
could have had a proper drubbing, or you would be
less reckless of your speech!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have always been pitted to fight with bragging
rascals of about your size and ability with a weapon,
else I might have been drubbed,” Adam flung back,
laying his hand on his sword as he spoke. “It shames
my steel to think of engaging a ten-pin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By all tokens, sir, you are blind, as well as idiotic,
to walk into death so heedlessly. Be good enough to
follow me into the yard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, fie on a death that flees and entreats me to
follow,” was Adam’s answer. “I rolled you once in
this hall; I can do so again. Halberd—Pike, candles
to place at the head and feet of death!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters, having reached the apartments appointed
for their use, had heard the disturbance in the
hall, and expecting trouble, had already lighted the
candles. With three of these they now came forth.
The hall would have been light enough had it been in
communication with the outside world and the twilight,
but as it was, it was nearly dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grieve for your mother,” sneered the stranger,
whose sword could be heard backing out of its scabbard.
“You must be young to be so spendthrift of
your life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the contrary, you will find what a miser I am,
even as to the drops of my blood,” said Adam. “No
one ever yet accused the Sachem——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“The Sachem!” interrupted the other voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Halberd, who had sheltered the candle he bore with
his hand, now threw its light on the face of the man
near by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shatter my hilt!” exclaimed young Rust,
“Wainsworth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Odds walruses!” said the man addressed as
Wainsworth, “what a pretty pair of fools we are. By
gad, Adam, to think I wouldn’t know you by your
voice!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had leaped forward, while his sword was
diving back into its sheath. He caught Wainsworth
by the hand and all but wrung it off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless your old soul,” he said, “why didn’t you
say who you were?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was kept busy listening to you telling me who
and what I was,” Wainsworth assured him, good-naturedly.
“I never heard so much truth in all my
life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never thought to be so incontinently found out
myself,” Adam confessed contritely. “But as long as
I have found you, I feel as good as if I had fought a
good fight and wiped my blade. Indeed, Henry, I am
tremendously glad to see you. How did you get here?
When did you come? What a blundering fool I was!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come in, come in to my castle,” said Wainsworth,
turning back to the apartment he had been quitting
when knocked over. “Bring in your friends. You
shall all share in my dinner. I’m a ship, burdened
with news for cargo to be unloaded. Come in here;
we’ll talk all night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am due at a dinner already, with my beef-eaters,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>said Rust. “I have been delayed past all
reason now, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You weren’t delayed by our duel of words, I
trust?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, but I have kept our host waiting, nevertheless.
I shall be back before the night’s worn
through, however, and then I am yours till breath fails
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haste away then, Sachem Rust, for the sooner you
are gone the sooner I shall see you returned; and I
shall consume myself with impatience till I can tell
you of the sweetest plight mortal man ever got himself
tangled in. I’ve got to tell you, for no one else on
earth would answer. Begone, then. Good-by, and
hasten back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam bade him au revoir, for he felt that already
William Phipps must be thinking him sadly remiss and
ungracious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Preparations as to evening dress were soon completed.
They consisted in a brisk wash of face and hands for
the trio, not one of the party being endowed with a
second suit of clothing. Thus they were upon the
road, walking soberly, though diligently, toward the
Captain’s residence, before the twilight had begun to
fade.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>’TWIXT CUP AND LIP.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>With</span> appetites still further whetted by their various
diversions, the comrades were hardly made happier
when Adam found that once more the many years’
growth of Boston town confused him. It was something
of a walk to the Phipps’ domicile from the Crow
and Arrow the best one could do. With devious windings
added, it became the next thing to provoking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha, at last I know where we are,” said Adam,
finally. “These streets are as bad as London’s. But
ten minutes more and we shall be at the board.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this is not so,” said Halberd, gravely, with a
memory of seeing Adam part with the last money
which they possessed, “it would be a kindness to let
us lie down and perish here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a most unlikely-looking street,” added
Pike, dolefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you know of Boston streets?” inquired
Adam, who had a doubt or two of the place himself.
“Good beef-eaters, if you weary, wait here for a moment,
till I can run a little along this road, to see
where it leads. If it is right I will presently whistle;
if wrong I can the sooner return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters with one accord sat down upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>block of stone, while their leader strode hastily up a
passage which was in reality an alley, at the rear of a
number of residences. With a hope that he would soon
emerge into a street which he thought should be in the
neighborhood, Adam almost ran. Thus he disappeared
about a turn of the lane.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had gone less than twenty rods when he found
himself approaching a small assemblage of boys, who
were yelling, in suppressed voices, and gathering stones
which they were throwing with wild aim into a corner,
where the coming darkness had already formed a
center of shadows. Rust was well among these young
scamps before they were aware of his presence. One
urchin had by this secured a long stick with which he
advanced, the others making room to let him through,
to poke and jab at something which the lads had evidently
driven to bay where it could not escape. Yet
so afraid did the young rogues appear to be that this
something would yet fly upon them and do them great
harm, that Adam walked at once among them, touching
one upon the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The witch!” screamed this lad, as if the devil
himself had clutched him. With yells of terror all
the boys scudded swiftly away, for a matter of twenty
feet, and then turned about to look at Rust. Seeing a
man merely, they were reassured. It is a singular and
doubtless a fortunate matter that there was never such
a thing conceived as a male witch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you here?” said Adam, pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A witch’s cat!” cried one of the boldest youths,
re-approaching. “We drove it in the corner to stone
it to death!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Now Adam had a lingering fondness for cats, from a
time not many years past.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A witch’s cat?” he repeated. “What nonsense!
What harm can a poor cat do to big healthy boys like
you? There are no witches, you young varlets.” He
went into the corner and peered about eagerly, to find
the dumb victim of the mad superstition then subtly
growing in that Massachusetts colony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was a witch and she ran away, screaming!”
scolded back the bold spokesman of the group of boys,
now gaining courage to edge nearer. “She ran away
through this garden!” He pointed to a rear yard,
leading off the alley to a house not far distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She made me cough up pins and needles,” asserted
another young liar, glibly. “And a monster black
monkey with cock’s feet followed her when she ran.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a prince of the powers of air himself,” whispered
another lad, in awe-stricken tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had found the cat, a middle-aged animal,
frightened, hurt, soiled, but intelligent, since it knew
it was being protected at last. He lifted it forth from
its small retreat, finding it to be a heavy, black-and-white
specimen, too inoffensive to scratch and claw,
even in its terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You young——” he started to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here she comes! Here she comes!” yelled one of
the lads, interrupting. “Two of them! Run for your
lives!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The self-scared young cowards, screaming like so
many demons, darted down the alley as fast as their
legs would let them go. Adam looked where one had
pointed and beheld, indeed, two female figures coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>on a distracted run through the near-by yard, toward
him as he was standing with the cat in his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the first veil of darkness was already drawn
through the air, Rust could see that they were two
young women who were coming. The one who led, he
then noted, was a plain, but a sweet, wholesome-looking
girl, who was evidently much excited. He stepped
forward toward her, with the cat, divining it was the
animal she had come for, and so for the moment he
neglected to glance at the second young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he did look at her she was not far and he
caught his breath quickly. “Shatter my hilt!” was
the thought that leaped into his brain, “they do have
young witches here after all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Advancing to the middle of the alley he made a profound
bow, as the foremost girl came pantingly from
the garden gate. The girl, seeing him now for the
first time, halted abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening,” said Adam, “may I have the honor
of restoring your pet? He is excellently well behaved
and, I trust, not seriously hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl walked timidly toward him. Her face
flushed rosy red with pleasure and confusion. Her
companion, having been caught on a rosebush, in the
garden, was delayed and was stooping to disentangle her
skirt from the thorns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, sir, you are very kind,” stammered the girl
confronting Adam. “I thought they would kill him.
He isn’t mine, but I also hold him——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The second young lady now came hastily out at the
gate. Adam had been too polite to look past number
one, in search for the one he thought so witching, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>now his heart bounded to see her coming. She ran
precipitately at him, breaking in upon her companion’s
speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Standing-Panther,” she cried, impetuously,
“my own dear, darling love, why did you ever come
out to such a place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She plucked her pet from Adam’s arm in one swoop.
Rust, at the old name, which he had buried with
memories that sorely harrowed his soul, dropped his
hat, which he had doffed, and raising his hand to his
cheek in wonder, stared at the girl before him with
widened eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At—at your service, Miss—Mistress Gar—Mistress
Merrill,” he stuttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, a vision of beauty distraught, suddenly looked
up in his face. Frank amazement was depicted in her
glorious eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg—your pardon,” stammered Adam, “I see
you were speaking to your cat, and not to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You!—Adam!—Mr.—Mr. Rust!” she exclaimed.
A red-hot blush surged upward, flooding her face, her
neck and even her delicate ears. “Not Little-Standing—Oh
dear me! Why, Prudence, what did I say?
It—it isn’t really——” she stopped in confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam Rust, Kneeling Panther at your service,”
supplied the rover. He made a bow that was truly
splendid, with a long sweep of his hat and a touch of
his knee on the pavement, that for sheer grace could
not have been equaled in Boston. “Miss—Mistress
Merrill, you have not quite forgotten that you commissioned
me to bring you something from Hispaniola?”
he added.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“But you—but you have grown so,” said Garde,
still as red as a rose. “And to meet like this—that
was such a long time ago. I—I thank you for saving
my cat. I—we—Prudence, you must thank Mr. Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Prudence, on whom Adam had scarcely looked, since
seeing Garde, had been standing there looking at Rust
with a sudden-born love in her eyes that was almost
adoration. She had developed, out of the Puritanical
spirit of the times, a control of her various emotions
that Garde would never possess. Therefore she had
herself in hand at a second’s notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thanked Mr. Rust,” she answered, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was stealing a look at Adam the second he
turned in politeness to Prudence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was no service at all,” he said. “Pray expend
no further words upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam, I am so glad——” burst from Garde’s
lips impetuously, but she checked her utterance the
instant his glance came flashing back to hers, and
added. “I mean, Mr. Rust, I am so glad the cat
wasn’t hurt, and, Prudence, we must surely return to
the house at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was not at all what Garde had started to say,
nor what she wanted to say; but though it was the
same Adam, quite to her heart’s satisfaction, yet he
was now a man, and a maidenly diffidence shamed her
riotous gladness, and—Prudence was present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” said Adam, fumbling in a pocket over the
region of his heart, “the trinket I brought you from
Hispaniola?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, marry, it has kept so well all these years,” said
Garde roguishly, “surely it must still keep till—surely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>anyway till daylight. Really, sir, we must thank you
again and return before it is actually dark.” She gave
him one look which, had he been a woman, he would
readily have interpreted, but being a man, somewhat
of its significance was lost upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But now I know I have kept it too long already,”
he insisted, still tugging at the stubborn pocket.
“Surely——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be the riper for keeping a little longer,”
said Garde, almost impatient with him for not seeing
that she wanted to receive it only when they two were
alone together. “We thank you once more, for saving
Little-Standing-Panther, and so—good night,”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But when—what day?—to-morrow?” cried the
eager rover. “When may I give it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh stupid!” said Garde to herself, almost vexed at
his lack of understanding and tact. Aloud she called
back, “Did you say good night? Prudence, say good
night again to Mr. Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Prudence called good night once more, this making
her third time, and Adam was left there in the alley
alone. He went to the gate and, leaning over it, clutched
two of its pickets in his hands, as once before he had
done to another gate, and stood there gazing ardently
into the gathering darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, with a heavy sigh, of joy and impatience
blended, he strode a little down the lane. Then he
strode back. So, up and down he paraded, for fifteen
minutes. At the end of this time he suddenly bethought
him of the beef-eaters and the dinner at William Phipp’s.
He then hastened, tardily enough, back the way he had
originally come.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Eager to find his companions, yet completely scatterbrained
by the meeting with Garde, the sight of her radiant
beauty, and the chaos of plans for seeing her again at
daylight, which were teeming in his head, he fairly fell
over the outstretched feet of his faithful followers
before he saw them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were still sitting upon the block of stone. They
had interlocked their arms, for mutual support, and
then had fallen fast asleep, worn out with the long day
and made weak by a longer fast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good old beef-eaters,” said Adam, affectionately,
and gently shaking them by the shoulders, he aroused
them, got them on their feet and guided them out of
the alley. By great good fortune, he came to a land-mark
he remembered from his short sojourn in Boston,
years before. With this as a bearing, he made good
time to the Captain’s house. They met William Phipps
at the gate, going forth to hunt them up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have sauntered along,” said Adam, carelessly,
“for such air as this is a tonic to the appetite.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE OPENING OF A VISTA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>For</span> a man who had taken so much tonic, Adam had
but indifferent relish for the savory and altogether comforting
little dinner which Goodwife Phipps had kept
all warm and waiting for the coming of her guests. His
head was filled with love and with altercations between
hope that Garde had meant this and fears that she
might have meant that, and with conjuring up all her
speeches and glances, till he could hardly have told
whether he was afoot or horseback.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if their leader neglected his opportunities, the
beef-eaters made good the reputation for three, as
swordsmen with knife and fork. Fortunately Goodwife
Phipps had provided amply. But a fowl became a
glistening skeleton; a hot meat-pie was represented at
last by a dish that yawned like an empty chasm; a
pyramid of Indian maize became a scattered wreckage
of cobs, and potatoes, bread and pudding vanished into
mere memories of what they once had been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, although he said nothing, talked like an
auctioneer, during the meal, to divert what he could of
the attention which his retinue perforce attracted to
their appetites. This innocent ruse was not lost on
the charming little wife of William Phipps. She was
a sweet little woman, plump, black-haired, brown-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and gifted by Nature with much vivacity, in her wit
and in her engaging manners. She was older than her
husband, having been the widow of one merchant Hull,
when she and the Captain wedded. They were a happy
couple, being indeed un-Puritanly joyous in their
partnership. She had taken a great liking to Adam,
when Phipps first brought him home. Now that he
was a man, she liked him none the less, yet she saw
that he would always be a big, straightforward boy. She
watched him now with pleasure, listening to his quips
and sallies of nonsense, and nodding motherly at his
evident concern for his two forlorn beef-eaters, so obviously
attached to him by ties of affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dinner being at length come to an end, with
great satisfaction to all concerned, Adam counseled the
expanded beef-eaters to fare to the Crow and Arrow,
lest in their absence anything befall to prevent their
occupancy of the selected apartments. As nothing was
to be had to drink where they were, the worthy two
were glad to act upon his suggestion. Accordingly
Adam and his hosts were left to themselves, whereupon
they fell upon a banquet of narrative and reminiscence
forthwith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Adam, tell us all about where you have been,
and what you have done, and all about everything,”
said Mrs. Phipps, putting her plump elbows on the
table, which she had swiftly cleared of the dinner
wreckage. “Just begin at the day you left, with William,
and tell us all there is. But tell us first, have you
fallen in love? Of course you must have, but I do
hope you will like one of our own girls best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear you would have me begin at the last end first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>after all,” said Adam, thinking how recently he had
fallen victim to Eros. “My tale is brief and of no interest.
William bade me cultivate the society of gentlemen,
when he sent me to England. Well, I had fencing
and fiddling of an Italian nobleman; I have fought
with holy friars and princes; I have sworn strange
oaths with prelates and bishops; I have danced with
nuns and duchesses; I have ridden to hounds with curs
and Kings. If I have not learned drinking, gambling,
love-making, dueling, swearing and sundry other pretty
accomplishments, then beshrew me for a clod and call
the court no place for schooling. I am richer than I
was, since I may look up at any moment and see you
both at a glance. By the same token I am happier.
As to my heart, I’ll take oath I left it in Boston. And
there you have me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, this sounds very naughty indeed,” said Mrs.
Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never counseled you to apprentice yourself to
the devil,” said Phipps. “You were first to learn
navigation, of some——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, of that I neglected to speak,” interrupted the
rover. “William, you will never make an anchor out
of sea foam, nor a solid ship’s master out of me, else
my first or my last preceptor would have finished me
off roundly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who was your latest chief?” the Captain inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain William Kidd,” said Adam, “a generous
friend, a fearless and skilful seaman, and as bold a
fighting man as ever clutched a hilt. I met him at
Barcelona, shipped with him for Bristol, fell in with
my beef-eaters, got rid of my money and pushed my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>sword through a pup—Lord Something-or-other——and
was still in time to catch Captain Kidd at Portsmouth
for New York. But I can’t bark enough for a sea-dog,
as Kidd was good enough to tell me himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps nodded and nodded. Outwardly he
was calm enough; inwardly he stewed with heat. Adam
had but added fuel to the fever of unrest and thirst for
adventure with which he had been born. He was not
jealous of all that his protégé had accomplished ahead
of himself—indeed, he had furthered the lad’s advancement,
at the expense of his own sense of bereavement
when he and Adam parted,—but he was consumed
with impatience to be hewing at the great career for
which he had from boyhood felt himself destined. A
light of determination burned in his eyes. He saw
that the boy before him had utterly outstripped him—the
boy to whom he had imparted all his own meager,
self-acquired education. Not for a moment did he regret
that from Hispaniola he had sent the lad to England,
with a fellow-captain, nor would he for any price
have stripped his protégé of one single experience, but
his mouth grew dry with the lust for adventure that
was glowing within him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His wife saw these indications. She understood what
was passing in his mind. Before she had even sighed
to herself, as a woman must, who feels herself on the
brink of a separation from one she truly loves, she consented
mentally to what she knew he would presently
suggest. What she was thus prepared for, came sooner
than she had expected it might.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” said Phipps, somewhat huskily, “I have
been waiting for something—I never knew what—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>come along and start me off after the fortune I have
promised to get for the wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are fortune enough for me, dear,” Mrs.
Phipps interposed, in spite of herself. “I should be
satisfied to live like this forever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” said the Captain, “but I promised you
should have a fair brick house in the Green Lane, to
the north, and I mean that you shall have it. Adam,
you are the something I have been waiting for, but
what with my worrying, over thinking you probably
dead, I have never realized the truth till this night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what may it be my privilege to do?” said
Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go with me to recover a fortune, sunk in a wreck.
She rests on a reef in the Bahamas, in a few fathoms
of water. She was laded with gold and went down
with every ounce. I’ve got the maps, and now that I’ve
got you, bless your heart, we can sail in a week!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how have you learned of this sunken treasure?”
said Adam, who for some reason appeared not
at all boyishly eager to set off on this new adventure.
“Has somebody given you this tale and the maps as
the price for a well-built brig?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had the information from a Spaniard, who died
at my ship-yard,” said Phipps. “He was the sole
survivor of the wrecked vessel. I gave him work. He was
grateful. Death seized him suddenly, but before the
end came, he told me his tale, he said, as a measure of
gratitude, directing me to feel in his pockets for the
maps, which I did. I have waited for what I now am
certain was your return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Adam, thoughtfully, twisting the ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of his small mustache, “you couldn’t easily have paid
me a greater compliment, I am sure; but, my dear
friend, you place me in an awkward position.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Awkward position? What awkward position?”
said Phipps. “Here you are a good swordsman, a man
of some knowledge, and the companion I would select
of all the men I know.” Here Adam bowed solemnly.
“Now what is to hinder us from making this venture
together? What do you mean by this awkward position
business?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean,” said the rover, “that I seem to serve no
better purpose, the moment I return to Boston, than to
separate you two good people. Now I am sensitive
about a thing like that. I don’t like to be the cause of
such a separation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What nonsense, you——” started the Captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I prepared my mind for William’s adventure, long
ago,” interrupted Mrs. Phipps. “If he doesn’t go with
you, he will go with some one else. And as long as he
is bent on going in the end, I should feel so much better,
Adam, if you were with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam bowed to them both, again. He was glad to
do this, as he was, in point of fact, somewhat confused
as to what to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, you young rascal,” said Phipps, “that
knocks away your shores and you are launched before
you know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” suggested Adam, with an air of great solicitude
for his friend’s interests, “do you really think any
wild-goose chase of this description could be as solid
and certain and wholesome as the ship-building business?
Would I be justified in encouraging you, Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Phipps, to leave your established business for such
a wild——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wild?” interposed Phipps. “You—you—now
look here, what do you mean—you, by your own
accounts, the wildest young scamp afloat? Wild? As
if anything could be too wild for you. There is something
at the bottom of all this. Now out with it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, William!” said Goodwife Phipps, “where
are your eyes? Why, Adam must have a sweetheart in
Boston!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust flushed hotly. His eyes would not, for all his
pulling at them, refrain from dancing. He conjured
up an immediate fit of coughing, and therefore held a
handkerchief before his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps looked at him suspiciously. “Is that what
ails you?” he demanded. “Is that why you are so
hot to remain here in Boston?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I leave it to you both, as two good, sensible
people,” said Rust, artfully, “how could such a catastrophe
have happened? I left Boston seven years ago,
while a mere cub, and I have been here now less than
that many hours. Do you think that between sunset
and my coming here I could have saved some fair
angel’s life—or the life of her—her—well, say her pet
panther? Does that seem likely, or reasonable,
say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t dare trust you not to be saving a dozen,”
grumbled Phipps. “When a man has associated with
gentlemen, you never can reckon on his conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it does seem absurd, Adam, I admit,”
said Mrs. Phipps, who was enjoying the conversation
mightily. “I had to make some suggestion. And—oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>why, perhaps some young lady has recently arrived
here from the old country. Is that it, Adam?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I give you my word of honor that no young lady
has come to Boston, since I went abroad, for whom I
care a brass farthing,” Adam assured his hostess. “The
further you go in this, the more innocent you will find
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then are you turned lazy, or what is it that ails
you,” inquired the Captain, “that you fail to leap, as,
by my word, I had thought you would, to embrace this
opportunity?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, oh, poor dear Adam,” said the Captain’s wife,
interrupting any answer Rust might have been framing,
“perhaps I know what it is, at last.” She went to her
husband quickly and whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum!” said Phipps, who was inclined to be a bit
short with his protégé for his many equivocal answers,
“Why couldn’t he say so at once? See here, Adam,
what’s all this rigmarole about your pride? If you
haven’t got any money, what’s the odds to me? Who’s
asking you to furnish any funds? I’ve got the brig
and I’ve got provisions and arms in plenty. If that is
what ails you, drop it, sir, drop it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, willing to share another’s money as readily
as he would give his own last penny to a friend, had
thought of nothing half so remote as this to offer as an
excuse for remaining in Boston, under the same sky
with Garde. But now that it was broached, he fathered
it as quickly and affectionately as if he had indeed been
its parent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had hoped it would not be unreasonable for me to
crave a few days’ grace before giving you my answer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>your generous proposition,” he said, “for I am not
without hopes of replenishing our treasury at an early
date.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But in the meantime——” started Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest,” interrupted his wife, with feminine tenderness
of thought for any innocent pride, “surely you
have no mind to sail to-night? And there are so many
things for Adam to tell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Captain, who had been drawing down his brow,
in that serious keep-at-it spirit which through all his
life was the backbone of his remarkable, self-made success,
slacked off the intensity of his mood and smiled
at his wife, indulgently. He loved her and he loved
Adam above anything else in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get you behind me, golden treasure,” he said, with
a wave of his big, wholesome hand. “Adam, I would
rather hear you talk than to pocket rubies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must be cautious lest I bankrupt myself by telling
all I know this evening,” said Adam. “Indeed,
dear friends, it grows late already. I must set my beef-eaters
the good example of keeping seemly hours.” He
arose to go before the sunken treasure topic should
again break out, with its many fascinations and pitfalls.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hosts protested against his leaving, yet they
presently discovered that the hour was, as he said, no
longer early. He therefore departed and wended his
way through the now deserted streets, toward the Crow
and Arrow, his heart bounding with joyousness, his
brain awhirl with memories of everything of the evening,
save the discussion of the sunken treasure.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A WEIGHTY CONFIDENCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>At</span> the tavern, when Adam entered, Halberd had
succumbed to a plethora of comfort, which had followed
too soon on the paucity thereof, which had been the
program of the three for many weeks. He was snoring
fiercely in a corner. Pike, on the other hand, was
inflated with life and activity of speech. He was
bragging eloquently, not only of his own prowess, but
also of that of Halberd and Adam as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam heard the end of a peroration of self-appraisement
in which the doughty Pike announced that one of
his recent feats had been the slaying of two murderous,
giant pirates with his naked fists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the sailors, dock-hands and tavern-loafers
who made up the auditors who were being entertained
by these flights of narrative, was a little, red-nosed,
white-eyed man of no significance, who now stood up
and removed his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you would like to have a bit of fun with me,”
said he. “I’ll play one of those pirates, till we see
what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pike looked at him ruefully, rubbing his chin while
thinking what to answer to this challenge. He then
waved his hand, grandly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good sir,” he said, “the Sachem, my honored associate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>has such an appetite for these encounters that
until he shall be satisfied I would have no heart to deprive
him of such good material as I can see you would
make for a fight. Doubtless I can arrange for him to
do you the honor you seek, after which I shall be pleased
to weep at your funeral.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would rather fight with him than you,” said the
would-be belligerent, “but before he comes, if you would
like to have your neck broken——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Satisfied that this business had gone far enough,
Adam strode into the tap-room, where the jovial spirits
had congregated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends,” he interrupted, “you can put your
necks to better purpose by pouring something down
them. Landlord, attend my guests. Pike——”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the pirate-exterminator had fled, first edging to
the door, at the appearance of his chief, and then
clattering up the stairs to the rooms above with a noise
like cavalry in full retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if you would like to fight,” started the accommodating
manikin, still in process of baring his drum-stick
arms, “why, Mr. Sachem——” but he was not permitted
to finish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave off the gab,” said a burly sailor. Clapping
his private tankard—a thing of enormous dimensions—fairly
over the little head of the challenger, he snuffed
him completely and suddenly lifted him bodily to the
top of the bar, amid the guffaws of the entire company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust lost no time in arousing Halberd, whom he
herded to the apartments aloft with brief ceremony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wainsworth, who had been sitting up in his room,
writing letters while he waited for Adam’s return, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>heard his friend coming and opened his door to bid him
welcome. With another big hand-shake, and a smile
over their recent mis-encounter, the two went into the
lighted apartment, Wainsworth closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a wonder you find me anything more than a
small heap of ashes,” said Wainsworth, “for I have
fairly burned and smoked with my eagerness to see you
back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can smell the smoke,” said Adam. “How very
like tobacco it is. And now that I am here I presume
you are quite put out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not in love or your wits would be as dull
as mine,” his friend replied. “But sit down, sit down,
and tell me all about yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you wanted to do the telling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I do, confound you, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s all this?” interrupted Adam. He had
caught sight, on the table, of two glittering heaps of
money, English coins, piled in two apparently equal
divisions on the cloth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That? Oh, nothing, your share and mine,” said
Wainsworth, taking Adam’s hat and sweeping one of
the heaps into its maw with utter unconcern. “Stow
it away and be seated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, but——” started Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stow it, stow it!” interrupted Wainsworth. “I
didn’t bother you with buts and whyfores when you
divided with me. I have something of more importance
to chat about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is ten times as much as I gave to you,” objected
Adam, doggedly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“You gave me ten times more than you kept yourself,
when it meant ten times as great a favor. I am
mean enough only to divide even,” answered Wainsworth.
“Say anything more about it, and I shall pitch
my share out of the window.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, Rust had impoverished himself
for this friend, when in England, at a moment most
vital in Wainsworth’s career. He had no argument,
therefore, against accepting this present, much-needed
capital. He placed the clinking coins in his pocket,
not without a sense of deep obligation to his friend. It
made one more bond between them, cementing more
firmly than ever that affectionate regard between them,
on the strength of which either would have made a
great personal sacrifice for the other. No sooner, however,
had Adam cleared his hat and weighted his
clothing with the money, than he realized that the only
good argument he had possessed to oppose to Captain
Phipps’ scheme to take him away from Boston, namely,
his poverty, was now utterly nullified. He started as if
to speak, but it was already too late. If the Captain
found him out, what could he say or do?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now then,” said Wainsworth, “we can talk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am an empty urn, waiting to be filled with your
tales and confessions,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wainsworth settled back in his chair and stroked his
small imperial, hung on his under lip. “Yes, we can
talk,” he repeated. He sat upright again, and once
more leaned backward. “I don’t know where to begin,”
he admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might start off by saying you’re in love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who told you I’m in love? I haven’t said so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>You’d be in love yourself, if ever you had met her.
She’s a beauty, Adam! She’s divine! She’s glorious!
Odds walruses, you’d be clean crazy about her! Why,
you would simply rave—you couldn’t be as calm as I am
if you knew her, Adam! She’s the loveliest, sweetest,
most heavenly angel that ever walked the earth! Why,
I can’t give you an idea! She,—she, she just takes
your breath! There is nothing in Boston like her—nothing
in the world. Why, man, you couldn’t sit still
if you had ever seen her!” He got up and paced the
room madly. “You could no more sit there and tell
me about her as I am telling you than you could drink
the ocean!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I suppose I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you couldn’t. I’m an older man than
you are—a whole year older—and I know what I am
talking about. You would go raving mad, if you saw
her. She is the most exquisite—Adam! She’s peerless!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you are in love?” said Adam. “Up to this
last moment I thought there might be some doubts
about it, but I begin to suspect perhaps you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Love? In love? My dear boy, you don’t know
what love is! I adore her! I worship her! I would
lay down my life for her! I would die ten thousand
deaths for her, and then say I loved her still!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would be a remarkable post-mortem power of
speech,” said Adam. “And I suppose she loves you
as fervently as you love her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course she does—that is,—now, now why would
you ask such a silly question as that? A love like mine
just reaches forth and surrounds her; and it couldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>do that if she didn’t—well, you know how those things
are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, certainly. If she loves you and you love her,
that makes it complete, and as I am a bit tired, and
this leaves no more to be said——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there is more to be said! Why don’t you ask
me some questions?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silly questions?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! Of course not! Some plain, common-sense
questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, is she beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Odds walruses, Adam, she is the most beautiful
girl that ever breathed. She surpasses rubies and diamonds
and pearls. She eclipses——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, but is she lovely?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lovely?—She’s a dream of loveliness. I wish you
could see her! You would throw stones at your grandmother,
if you could see how lovely she is. Lovely!—Can’t
you invent some better word—something that
means more? Lovely doesn’t express it. Go on, go
on, ask me something more!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, well, is she pretty or plain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is most radiantly beautiful.—Look here, Adam,
you think I am an ass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear old fellow, I didn’t stop to think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are making fun of me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible, Henry. You told me to ask you some
simple questions. Does she live here in Boston?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She does, of course she does, or I shouldn’t be here,
should I? She lives here and Boston has become my
Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, well, thanks for your hospitality. Let’s see,—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>she beauti—but I may have asked that before.” He
yawned and rubbed his eyes to keep them open. “Oh,
I do think of another. What is her name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her name?” chuckled Wainsworth, walking up
and down in an ecstasy of delight. “Her name is the
prettiest name in the universe. It’s Garde—Garde
Merrill—Garde! Oh, you just love to say Garde, Garde,
Garde!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam started, suddenly awake and alert. He passed
his hand across his eyes stiffly. His face became as
pale as paper. Wainsworth was still walking restlessly
up and down, intent on his own emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a name like a perfume,” he went on. “Garde,
Garde. You can’t think how that name would cling
to a man’s memory for years—how it rings in a man’s
brain—how it plays upon his soul!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was thinking like lightning. Garde!—She
loved Wainsworth—he had said so. It was this that
had made her appear so restrained, unnatural, eager to
return to the house. This was why her answers had
been so evasive. The whole situation broke in on him
with a vividness that stunned his senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mad thought chased through his brain. It was
that, if he had spoken first, this moment of insupportable
pain could have been avoided, but that Wainsworth
having spoken first had acquired rights, which he, as
a friend, loving him dearly, would be bound to respect.
He thought of the money he had just accepted from
this brother-like friend. He saw the impossibility of
ever saying to Henry that he too loved Garde Merrill—had
loved her for seven years—had heard her name
pealing like the bell of his own very being in his soul!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>But no—he couldn’t have spoken! He knew that. He
would never dare to say that she loved him, in return
for the love he had fostered for her, these seven years.
No, he could not have spoken of her like this to any
soul, under any circumstances. To him her name was
too precious to be pronounced above a whisper to his
own beating heart. He did not realize that, by that
very token of her sacredness to him, he loved her far
more deeply, far more sublimely than could any man
who would say her name over and over and babble of
his love.</p>

<p class='c007'>He only knew that his brain was reeling. He could
only see that Wainsworth, for whom he would have
sacrificed almost anything, was all engrossed in this
love which must mean so much. He only realized that
all at once he had lost his right to tell this dearly beloved
friend the truth, and with this he had also lost
the right, as an honorable comrade, to plead his own
soul’s yearning at the door of Garde’s heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wainsworth, in his ecstatic strolling and ringing of
praises, was tolling a knell for Adam, saying “Garde”
and then “Garde” and again presently “Garde,” which
was the only word, in all his rapid talk that reached
the other’s ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam arose, unsteadily. Wainsworth had not observed
his well-concealed agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—must be going,” said Rust, huskily, turning his
face away from the light. He tried to feign another
yawn. “I am no longer good company. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, going?” said Henry, catching him affectionately
by the shoulders. “Ah, Adam, I suppose I
am a bit foolish, but forgive me. You don’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>what it is to love as I have learned to love. And, dear
friend, it has made me love you more—if possible—than
ever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good night, Henry,” said Adam, controlling his
voice with difficulty. “Good night—and God bless
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say ‘God bless Mistress Garde Merrill’—for my
sake,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked at him oddly and repeated the words
like a mere machine.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam</span> returned to his room attempting to pucker his
lips for a careless whistle which failed to materialize.
He had evolved a rude but logical philosophy of his
own for every phase of life; but what philosophy ever
fooled the maker thereof, with its sophistries?</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters were snoring so ominously that Adam
was constrained to think of two volcanoes threatening
immediate eruptions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor old boys!” he said to himself. There was no
particular reason for this, save that he felt he must
pity something, and self-pity he abhorred. He was trying
not to think of the one companion that always
drew his emotions out of his reluctant heart and gave
them expression—his violin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Standing in the middle of the floor, without a light
in the room, he reasoned with himself. He said to his
inner being that doubtless Wainsworth loved her more
than he did anyway; that he, Adam, having carried
away a boyish memory, which he had haloed with
romanticism for seven years, could not call his emotions
love. Moreover, he had as yet only seen her in
the dark, and might not be at all attracted by her true
self in the daylight. Naturally, also, Wainsworth had
as much right in the premises as any man on earth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>no man could expect a girl to remember a mere homely
lad for seven years and know that he loved her, or that
he thought he did, and so reciprocate the affection and
calmly await his return. Clearly he was an absurd
creature, for he had fostered some silly notion in his
heart, or brain, that Garde was feeling toward him, all
these years, as he felt toward her. It was fortunate he
had found everything out so soon. The thing to do
now was to think of something else.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the while he was thus philosophizing, he had a
perfect subconsciousness that told him the violin would
win—that soon or late it would drag his feelings out of
him, in its own incomparable tones. He only paused
there arguing the matter because he hated to give in
without a fight. That violin always won. It must
not be permitted to arrogate to itself an absolute
mastery over his moods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, beginning to admit that he would yet
have to tuck the instrument under his chin, whether or
no, he worked out a compromise. He would not play
it, or sound it, or fondle it in the town. If it wanted
to voice things and would do it—well, he would carry
it out into the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Feeling that he had, in a measure, conquered, Rust
stole silently across the apartment to the corner in
which he had placed the violin with his own loving
hands, lifted the case without making a sound and
crept out as if he had been a thief, pressing the box
somewhat rigidly against his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached the street without difficulty. The town
was asleep. A dog barking, a mile away, and then a
foolish cock, crowing because he had waked, were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>only sounds breaking over all Boston. The last thin
rind of the moon had just risen. In the light it cast,
the houses and shadows seemed but a mystic painting,
in deep purple, blacks and grays. Silently as Adam
could walk, these houses caught up the echo of his
footfalls, and whispered it on, from one to another, as if
it had been a pass-word to motionless sentinels.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came to the Common, discerning Beacon Hill,
dimly visible, off to the right. With grass under foot
he walked more rapidly. Past the watch-house and the
powder-house, in the center of the Common, he strode,
on to Fox Hill and then to the Roxbury Flats, stretching
wide and far, to the west of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being now far from all the houses, alone in an area
of silence, Adam modified his gait. He even stood
perfectly still, listening, for what he could not have
heard, gazing far away, at scenes and forms that had
no existence. Night and solitude wrought upon him
to make him again the boy who had lived that free,
natural existence with the Indians. His tongue could
not utter, his imagination could not conceive, anything
concrete or tangible out of the melancholy ecstasy
which the night aroused in his being and which seemed
to demand some outward response from his spirit. He
felt as if inspiration, to say something, or to do something,
were about to be born in his breast, but always
it eluded him, always it was just beyond him and all
he could do, as his thought pursued it, was to dwell
upon the sublimity breathing across the bosom of
Nature and so fairly into his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had come away without his hat. Bareheaded, at
times with his eyes closed, the better to appreciate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>earth in its slumber, he fairly wantoned in the coolness,
the sweetness and the beauty of the hour. Thus it
was past three o’clock in the morning when at length
he came to the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man might build a palace of gold and brilliants, or
Nature grow an edifice of leaves all resplendent with
purples, reds, yellows and emeralds, but, when night
spread her mantle, these gems of color and radiance
might as well be of ebon. It is the sun that gilds,
that burnishes, that lays on the tints of the mighty
canvas; and when he goes, all color, all glitter and all
beauty, save of form, have ceased to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam saw the trees standing dark and still, their
great black limbs outstretched like arms, with upturned
hands, suppliant for alms of weather. There was something
brotherly in the trees, toward the Indians, Adam
thought, and therefore they were his big brothers also.
He had even seen the trees retreating backward to the
West, as the Red men had done, falling before the
march of the great white family.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Nature has aught of awe in her dark hours, she
keeps it in the woods. The silence, disturbed by the
mystical murmuring of leaves, the reaching forth of
the undergrowth, to feel the passer-by in the depth of
shadows, the tangled roots that hold the wariest feet
until some small animal—like a child of the forest—can
scamper away to safety, all these things make such
a place seem sentient, breathing with a life which man
knows not of, but feels, when alone in its midst.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Adam all these things betokened welcome. His
mood became one of peculiar exultation, almost, but
not quite, cheer. As a discouraged child might say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“I don’t care, my mother loves me, anyway, whether
anybody else does or not,” so Adam’s spirit was feeling,
“If there is no one else to love me, at least I am
loved by the trees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this little joy at his heart, he penetrated yet a bit
further into the absolute darkness, and sitting down
upon a log, which had given his shins a hearty welcome,
he removed his violin from its case and felt it over
with fond hands and put its smooth cheek against his
own cheek, before he would go on to the further ecstasy
which his musical embrace became when he played to
tell of his moods.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now something jolly, my Mistress,” he said to the
instrument, as if he had doubts of the violin’s intentions.
“Don’t be doleful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Like a fencer, getting in a sharp attack, to surprise
the adversary at the outset, he jumped the bow on to
the strings with a brisk, debonair movement that
struck out sparks of music, light and low as if they
were played for fairies. It was a sally which soon
changed for something more sober. It might have
seemed that the fencer found a foe worthy his steel and
took a calmer method in the sword-play. Then a moment
later it would have appeared that Adam was on
the defensive.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, it was next to impossible for Rust
to play bright, lively snatches of melody, this night,
try as he might. The long notes, with the quality of
a wail in them, got in between the staccato sparkles.
When Adam thought of the Indians, their minor compositions
transmitted themselves through his fingers
into sound, before he was aware. He had braced himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>stiffly on philosophy all the way to this forest-theater,
but to little avail. He presently stopped
playing altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he loves her and she loves him,” he told himself,
resolutely, “why, then, it is much better that two
should be happy than that all three should finally be
made miserable by some other arrangement, which a
man like me, in his selfishness, might hope to make.
It’s a man’s duty, under such circumstances, to dance
at the wedding and be a jolly chap, and——hunt around
for another girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He attacked the violin again, when it was apparently
off guard, and rattled off a cheerful ditty before the
instrument could catch its breath, so to speak. Then
a single note taunted him with a memory, and the
violin nearly sobbed, for a second, till the jig could
recover its balance. The strings next caught at a laggard
phrase and suddenly bore in a relentless contemplation
of the future and its barren promise. The
brighter tones died away again. So went the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trying his best to compel the violin to laugh and
accept the situation, while the instrument strove to
sigh, Adam played an odd composition of alternating
sadness and careless jollity, the outpouring being the
absolute speech of his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>He played on and on. Inasmuch as his philosophy
was as right as any human reasoning is likely to be,
Adam’s more cheerful nature won. But the victory
was not decided, no more than it was permanent. Yet
he was at last the master of the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heedless of the time as he had been, in his complete
absorption, Rust had not observed the coming of morning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Nevertheless the sun was up, and between the
branches of the trees it had flung a topaz spot of color
at his feet—a largess of light and warmth. Without
thinking about it, or paying any attention to it, Adam
had fixed his eyes on this patch of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly his senses became aware that the spot had
been blotted out of existence. He looked up and beheld
a vision of loveliness—as fair a nymph as ever enjoyed
a background of trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Garde.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE MEETING IN THE GREENWOOD.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>With</span> her glorious mahogany-colored hair loose in
masses on her shoulders, with her eyes inquiring, and
her lips slightly parted as she stole forward, thrilled
with the exquisite beauty of Adam’s playing, in such
a temple of perfect harmonies, Garde appeared like the
very spirit of the forest, drawn from sacred bowers by
the force of love that vibrated the instrument’s strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>No bark of pine tree was browner than her eyes;
no berries were redder than her lips, nor the color that
climbed upward in her cheeks, the white of which was
as that of the fir beneath its outer covering. As some
forest dryad, maidenly and diffident, she held her hand
above her heart when Adam looked up and discovered
her presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man leaped to his feet, like one startled from
sleep. It almost seemed as if a dream had brought
him this radiant figure. No word came, for a moment,
to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—it’s you!” said Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde!—Miss—Mistress Merrill!” said Adam,
stammering. “By my hilt, I—the—the wonder is ’tis
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all,” corrected Garde, recovering something
that passed for composure. “I come here frequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to gather herbs and simples for Goody Dune, but for
you to be here, and playing—like that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” agreed Adam, when he had waited in vain
for her to finish, “perhaps it is an intrusion. You—you
came away from the town early.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you come here to play?” she asked.
Her own nature so yearned over the forest and things
beautiful, her own emotions were so wrought upon by
the sublimity of earth’s chancels of silence, that she
felt her soul longing for its kindred companion, who
must be one reverent, yet joyous, where Nature ruled.
She wanted Adam to pour forth the tale of his brotherhood
with the trees and the loneliness of his heart, that
would make him thus to play in such a place and at
such a time. While she looked at him, the love she
had fostered from her childhood was matured in one
glorious blush that welled upward from her bosom to
her very eyes themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had looked at her but once. It was a long
look, somewhat sad, as of one parting with a dear companion.
In that moment he had known how wholly
and absolutely he loved her. His pretended doubts
of the night before had fled as with the darkness.
The daylight in her eyes and on her face had made him
henceforth a sun-worshiper, since the sun revealed her
in such purity of beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the great delight which had bounded in his breast
at seeing her there, he had momentarily forgotten his
conversation with Wainsworth. When she asked him
why he had come to the woods, he would fain have
knelt before her, to speak of his love, to tell of his anguish
and to plead his cause, by every leap of his heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>but he had remembered his friend and his old Indian
schooling in stoicism gathered upon him, doubtless for
the very presence of the firs and pines, so solemn and
Indianesque about him. He put on a mask he had
worn over melancholy often.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I came here for practise, of which I am sadly
in need,” he said. “When once I played before King
Pirate and his court of buccaneers, I was like to be
hung for failing, after a mere six hours of steady scraping
at the strings. If you came for simples, verily you
have found a simple performer and simple tunes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was painfully disappointed in him. His flippancy
had, as he intended it should, deceived her.
She shut that little door of her heart through which
her soul had been about to emerge, ready to reveal
itself to and to speak welcome to its mate. She did not
cease to love him, emotional though she was, for love
is like a tincture, or an attar,—once it is poured out,
not even an ocean of water can so dilute it as to leave
no trace of its fragrance, and not until the last drop
in the ocean is drained can it all be removed or destroyed.
No, she was pained. She desired to retreat,
to take back the overture which, to her mind, had been
a species of abandon of her safeguards and so patent
that she could not conceive that Adam had failed to
note its significance. Yet she gave him up for a soulless
Pan reluctantly. That playing, which had drawn
her, psychically, physically, irresistibly to his side,
could have no part with things flippant. It had been
to her like a heart-cry, which it seemed that her heart
alone could answer. And when she had found that it
was Adam playing—her Adam—she had with difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>restrained herself from running to him and sobbing
out the ecstasy suddenly awakened within her. The
memory of the music he had made was still upon her
and she was timidly hopeful again when she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long have you been practising here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam mistook this for a little barb of sarcasm. His
mind was morbid on the subject of Wainsworth and of
Garde’s evasiveness of the evening before. He put on
more of the motley.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not half long enough,” he said, “by the violence
I still do to melody; and yet too long by half, since I
have frightened the birds from the forest. There is
always too much of bad playing, but it takes much bad
practising to make a good performer. I am better at
playing a jig. Shall I try, in your honor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, if you please, no, I would rather you
would not,” said Garde. It was her first Puritanical
touch. If she had given him permission to play his jig,
very many things might have been altered, for Adam
would have revealed himself and would have opened her
heart-doors once again, such a mastery over everything
debonair in his nature would the violin have assumed,
with its spell of deeper emotions, inevitable—with
Garde so near.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam laughed, well enough to appear careless. “I
commend your judgment,” he said, “though I have
always thought, even after last night,—ah, by the way,
where is your companion, Mistress Prudence somebody?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had parried his own tendency to get back to the
tender subjects and memories flooding his heart, but
not in a manner to gladden Garde. Indeed, the ring of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>artificiality in everything he said made her less and less
happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her name is Prudence Soam. She is my cousin,
and she is at home,” said Garde, quietly. “If you
would care to see her again, I will tell her of your wish.”
She could readily understand how any one might like
Prudence, knowing what a sweet, good girl her cousin
was, but it caused her an acute pain to think she had
cherished the image of Adam in her heart for seven
years, only to find now that he had been inconstant.</p>

<p class='c007'>She suddenly thought of the meeting of the evening
before. Adam’s willingness to present her—in the presence
of Prudence—with that something which he had
brought her from his first trip to Hispaniola, appeared
to her now in a light, not of his stupidity, but of his
deliberate intention to show her that he had not preserved
a sacred dream of their childhood friendship, as
she had so fondly hoped he had. She even wondered
if he might not have seen, known and cared for Prudence
before. She concluded that he cared for Prudence now,
and certainly not for herself. Then she thought he
might think of that something, which he had wished
so to give her—that something from Hispaniola,—and
she feared he might present it to her now. This would
have been too much to bear, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was indeed thinking on this very subject, but
Wainsworth—his friend—arose like a specter in his
meditations, and all that Garde had said had confirmed
him in his belief of her coldness to himself, so that he
preferred to seem to forget the trinket, which would
have been at once the token of his love and constancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mistress Prudence Soam,” Adam repeated, replying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>to Garde’s last remarks. “Indeed I should be but a
sorry clod, not to wish to see her again. Does she also
come searching for simples?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied Garde, a little dully. “But I thank
you for reminding me that I must set about my task.
Therefore I must bid you good day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam thought something would snap inside his breast.
There was the sunlight, streaming through the aisles
of the trees; there was Garde, whom he loved beyond
anything of earth, setting off alone when he should be
at her side, culling her herbs, touching her hands as
he gave her the aromatic leaves that he too knew so well,
and looking into Paradise through her eyes, that had
so danced when first he knew them. But what of
Wainsworth? What of the honor of a friend to a
friend?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good day,” he echoed, with a mock gaiety that
struck painfully on the ears of both. “I trust your
quest will be as successful as I could wish your life to
be happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hesitated a moment, for it was hard to part thus.
Garde had hoped he might volunteer to go along and
carry the tiny basket she held on her arm, for a woman’s
love can never be so discouraged as not to have a new
little hope every other moment that something may
happen to set matters aright in spite of all. But Adam
did not dare to prolong this test of his honor to Wainsworth.
He felt that his head was reeling, but with a
stately bow he took a final, lingering look at the sweetest
vision he had ever seen, and started away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, steadied by her pride, returned his bow and
walked further into the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Adam felt that he must pause and turn; that the
“Garde!” that welled up from his heart would burst
through his lips in spite of all he could do. With his
violin clasped beneath his arm, however, he conquered
himself, absolutely, and never so much as turned about
again to see where the wood-nymph had gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Garde could not so slay her dearest impulse.
She turned before she had gone ten steps. Looking
back, she saw Adam, bareheaded, crowned by his golden
ringlets,—through which the sunbeams were thrust
like fingers of gilt,—trailing his sword, clutching his
violin, striding off in his boots as lithely as a panther
and bearing up under his faded brown coat as proudly
as a king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam!” she said, faintly, but he was already
too far away to hear the little wood-note which her
voice had made.</p>

<p class='c007'>He disappeared. She knew he would soon be clear
of the trees. Reluctantly at first, and then eagerly,
though silently, she flitted along from tree to tree,
where he had gone, till at length she came to the edge
of the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, heavy with Wainsworth’s gold, was walking
less buoyantly now. He was far out on the flat, heading
southward, not exactly toward Boston. Garde
watched him yearningly, going, going and never once
looking backward to where he had left her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could bear no more. She sank down on the
moss at the foot of a tree, and leaning against the
gnarled old trunk, she covered her face with her hands
and cried, heart-brokenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had she watched but a moment longer, she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>have seen Adam halt, slowly turn about, and with his
hand at his lips gaze toward the woods steadily for
fully a minute. Then with a slow gesture he waved a
kiss back to where she was and once more went upon
his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man had no mind to walk through Boston in
daylight, with his violin naked in his hands. Keeping
therefore southward, he came at length to the upper
part of the harbor. Here he engaged a boatman with
a sloop to convey him down to the ship-yard of Captain
William Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The worthy ship-builder soon made him welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William,” said Adam, “I have replenished the
treasury, as I said I might, and I have made up my
mind to join you in your treasure-hunting expedition.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>PAYING THE FIDDLER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Assume</span> a cheerfulness, if you have it not, and it
may presently grow upon you. This happened to Adam,
so that when he left Captain Phipps, to return to the
tavern for his breakfast and to seek out the beef-eaters,
his mood was almost volatile again. There is much
virtue in having something other than one’s troubles
to think upon. The sunken treasure afforded Adam a
topic.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made his way to his apartments in the Crow and
Arrow by the stairs at the rear. He found the rooms
empty. Beef-eaters, bag and baggage were gone. Even
the violin-case was not to be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat surprised that his faithful followers would
so desert him, or at least move the family habitation
without consulting their comrade, and on notice so
brief, Rust knocked on Wainsworth’s door, to ask
him if he had seen anything of the worthy Pike and
Halberd. But Wainsworth too was out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon proceeding post haste down to the tap-room,
Adam broke in upon a scene of armistice, after a first
shock of war. Standing at bay, with drawn swords,
the shabby chattels of the trio in a corner behind them,
were the beef-eaters, confronting and defying the landlord
and several valiant citizens, in the midst of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>was the small individual who had so much desired to
fight, on the previous evening, and who was now
haranguing the opposing forces volubly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here comes the master-vagabond now!” he cried,
the moment Adam appeared in the room. “Now,
sirs, for your proof that you are not a pack of wandering
beggars and braggarts!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last!” cried Halberd and Pike, together, coming
quickly forward to grasp their comrade in arms by the
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have defended your good name and possessions!”
said Pike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have flung the lie into the teeth of these
varlets!” added Halberd. “You have come in good
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the meaning of all this business?” demanded
Adam, of the assembled company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one started to talk or to shout at once. Adam
heard such things as:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have called you and us a lot of penniless
beggars and pirates!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you but a swaggering bully?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a fiddling limb of Satan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The landlord said, more moderately, “I did but
desire to protect my house in its good repute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fierce little white-eyed man waved both his fists.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These dogs,” he snapped to Adam, “have boasted
that you are loaded down with gold!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, they mentioned gold,” said the landlord,
tentatively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gold?” said Adam. “Is it a crime to have no
gold? How much gold would you see?” he pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>his two hands from his pockets and scattered heaps of
yellow sovereigns on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters nearly collapsed with amazement, at
the sight of this wealth. The landlord fell to rubbing
his hands with ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You unseemly traducers of fair gentlemen,” he
said, with virtuous indignation, to the belligerents
behind him, “how dare you come here to insult and
to villify my guests?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He probably stole it,” cried the incorrigible little
white-eyed terrier. “He has naught to do but to
make God-fearing men——and his betters, at that—dance
against their will in the public streets!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” said Adam, striding forward and purposely
bending with great show of looking down to where the
little man was standing, “so you have come to pay the
fiddler for the sport which your friend enjoyed yesterday
evening? How little he reckons my fiddling
worth. This is so sad that nothing short of a breakfast
can console me. Landlord——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Braggart! knave!” cried the little man, interrupting.
“I offer to fight you again! You dare not
fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The smaller the dog the rarer the punishments and
the larger the arrogance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shatter my hilt!” said Adam, “you and another
gnat would devour me whole.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without warning, and yet gently, Rust took him by
the collar, twirled him about so that he could lay his
other hand on the trousers of the midget, and hoisting
him off his feet, though he kicked and made a disturbance
with yelling and raving, carried him at once to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the open window of the tavern and dropped him out,
on the sidewalk beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three or four partisans, who had backed up little
white-eyes and the landlord, now edged toward the
door. Adam made one motion in their direction and
they got out with becoming alacrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lock that door till we have had our breakfast,” Rust
commanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The landlord had no more than complied, than the
little rat, dropped from the window, came banging
against the barrier on the outside, demanding admittance
vociferously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is yon whiffet?” Adam asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His name is Psalms Higgler,” laughed the landlord,
with fine hypocrisy. “How bravely you served him,
and rightly too.” He rubbed his hands gleefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And his friend who sent him hither, he that danced
so divertingly, what may be his name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isaiah Pinchbecker, you doubtless mean. And
what will you have for breakfast, sire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will have you carry my bales of merchandise back
to my apartments,” said Adam, who did not propose to
move out of the house until he felt inclined, preferring
to remain there and command respect for himself and
the beef-eaters, even while he knew that the landlord
had joined the miserable snappers at his heels. “And
look to it you move smartly and return to order something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The landlord, spurred by the sight of the gold, and
eager to make all possible amends for the errors of
judgment he had committed, staggered up the stairs,
panting like a grampus.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Adam now turned to his comrades, who recited three
times over the incidents of the morning, which consisted
chiefly of the charges made by Psalms Higgler,
evidently at the instigation of Pinchbecker—the nimble-footed—and
which had so nearly culminated in their
expulsion from the tavern.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tempest in a teapot as it had been, the business was
an indication of feelings which went as deep as politics,
in which the whole colony had been simmering for
years. Moreover, the incident was not yet concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same year which had witnessed King Philip’s
war, at the close of which Adam had gone away, one of
the greatest mischief-makers with whom the Colonists
had ever been called upon to deal, Edward Randolph,
had come to Boston with a design to despoil the colony
of its charter. He had worked openly, in some directions,
secretly in others. He had enlisted malcontents,
dissenters-from-everything, hypocrites and men with
private greeds, in his Tory following. Among these
were Pinchbecker, his friend, the landlord of the Crow
and Arrow, Psalms Higgler and many others of their
ilk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Pinchbecker came under the category of hypocrites.
He assumed the Puritans’ manners, speech and
customs, and did, in fact, despise some of the looser
habits of the Royalists, though he was their willing
tool, working for future favor and gain. He had therefore
felt himself sorely aggrieved when compelled to
his dance, in a public highway, and having first egged
on his little terrier, Psalms, had then repaired to
Edward Randolph, himself, for redress of his wrongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph, thinking he smelt a bluff and ready Tory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>lot, in Adam, and his company, found occasion to visit
the tavern without delay. He arrived while Rust and
the beef-eaters were still at their breakfast. He entered
the house at the rear and ordered a drink at the bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Motioning the landlord to silence, that worthy being
much astonished to see him so early, Randolph presently
turned about, as if he had not before observed the
trio at table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I drink ill when I drink
alone; will you not permit me to order something in
which you can join me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked up. “Thank you,” he said, “it is our
misfortune to have ordered, just as you were coming in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The misfortune is mine,” insisted Randolph. He
drank alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust had taken in the visitor’s details at a glance.
The man was of medium size and nervous temperament.
He had a great brow, heavy with perceptive faculties,
at the expense of those of reflection. His eyes were
deep-set, round, intense and close together, the nose
that divided them being as thin and curved as a beak.
His lips were thin and tight-shutting. He looked like
a human bird-of-prey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By your dress and manner you are recently from
England,” said the man, sauntering leisurely toward
Adam, when he had smacked his lips and set down his
mug.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By your courtesy,” said Adam, “you are a student,
curious to know your fellow-beings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph laughed. “Curious?” said he. “You
do me wrong. I care neither who nor what a gentleman
is, so long as he is witty and blest with humor. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>repute and the tale of your love for dancing have preceded
you, sir. I confess I was tempted to come here
and see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beseech you for an opportunity to say that I was
merely charitable,” said Rust. “I ordered the dance
to amuse my beef-eaters. Perhaps you are a dancer
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph bit his lip. He was not getting on to his
liking. He smiled, however, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have few graces, after I have mentioned a sense
of admiration——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And blandishment,” put in Adam, who frankly disliked
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say appreciation, rather,” corrected Randolph. “I
have had a hearty laugh over that dance. I wish I had
been there to see it; such merriment is so rare in
Massachusetts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly as rare as introductions between gentlemen,”
Adam answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>He tipped up his mug and drank the last of his brew
carelessly. Randolph turned red with anger. His gray
eyes looked like cold fire, yet he was still unwilling to
accept defeat in his effort to find out the bent of Adam’s
political views.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We live in a time when the stoutest friends and
companions in good causes might be lost to each other
by formality,” he said, with a smile doing its best to
bend his features. “I must beg your pardon, if I
seem——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was interrupted by the entrance, at this moment,
of William Phipps, who came in at the door which the
landlord had quietly unbolted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“What, Adam, not yet done with eating?” he called
out, bluntly. “Come, come, I have been waiting this
long time for you and your friends to have a look over
the brig.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With you at once,” rejoined the rover.</p>

<p class='c007'>He and the beef-eaters knocked over their heavy
chairs and stools, as they arose from the table. Phipps
looked at Randolph. The two men nodded, distantly
and somewhat frowningly. Without so much as glancing
at Randolph, Adam and his retinue walked to the
door and so away, with the Captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph needed no further intimation of Adam’s
probable leanings, politically, than this obvious camaraderie
with Phipps—who was a patriot as immovable
and staunch as a rock fortress. He clenched his fists
and ground his molars savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Curse the young fool!” he said. “I’ll make him
wish for a civil tongue to be hung in his head!”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A MATTER OF STATE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Mistress Garde Merrill</span>, having several hours before
delivered her simples and aromatic leaves to old
Goody Dune, just outside the limits of the town, stood
looking out of the window, at her Uncle John Soam’s
home, where she was visiting. Thus it was that she saw
her grandfather, David Donner enter the gate. Two
minutes afterward she beheld the unusual sight of three
Governors come into the garden together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first was ex-Governor Leverett, that stern old
Roundhead, the ex-Captain of Cromwell’s horse. At
his side was Governor Winslow, up from Plymouth, on
grave affairs. Behind them was an older man, and perhaps
a wiser one, Governor Simon Bradstreet, still hale
and hearty after fifty-three years of service to the
colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bringing up the rear of the little procession was Henry
Wainsworth, private secretary to Leverett. He looked
toward the windows in the hope of seeing Garde, but
that young lady stepped silently back into the shadows,
for she had no desire to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither David Donner nor the other visitors came to
the house, nor even to the front door thereof. It was
a fine day, so that the garden seemed all smiles. A
cow was mooing lustily and chickens were singing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>their contentment. These sounds were interspersed
with the hawing of a saw, and then with hammer
strokes, these latter disturbances issuing from a newly
constructed granary and cow-shed which John Soam,
Garde’s uncle, had recently afforded.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner, who had known that he would find
Goodman Soam in this shed, had tracked across the
garden without ceremony. The governors and Wainsworth,
having confidence that Donner knew what he
was doing, followed where he led, to the center whence
the clatter of industry proceeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hammer-pounding had abated nothing, nor did
it cease when the three grave citizens and Wainsworth
had entered the house and ranged themselves silently
beside David Donner, to whom they could not well
speak for the din. They nodded to their friend, however,
and looked up, like students of astronomy all of
one mind, at Goodman Soam above them.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Soam had never been reputed a carpenter of
talent in Boston. However, here he was, standing on
the head of a barrel and obviously completing the task
of ceiling this room of the granary, for his head, shoulders
and arms were out of sight, in the darksome region
above the ceiling, while part of his body and his
legs, below, moved in vigorous jerks as he pounded into
place and nailed what appeared to be the last board
but one which would be needed to complete the job on
which he was so commendably engaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to his visitors that they had never before
seen Goodman Soam in so tight an orifice as was the
one from which he now protruded. They waited in
patience for the nailing to cease, conversation being impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>meantime. John was, by all reckoning, a
thorough workman, for he drove home nail after nail,
without ceasing for so much as a breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the board was secured to the carpenter’s
satisfaction, for he ceased to hammer and could be
heard to feel his work lovingly as he examined its
beauties in the half light in which he had labored.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morrow, John Soam,” now said Governor
Leverett, having first coughed behind his hand. “Here
are several fellow-townsmen come to your place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John was seen to give a squirm. “Oh, good morrow,”
said he, his voice muffled by the ceiling between him
and his friends. “I have been doing a little work.
Wait a moment, good friend, till I may gather my nails
and tools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The five good men waited, hearing John scramble the
nails together with a few metallic clinks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We went first to your house, David,” said John Winslow
to David Donner. “We came to see you and
John Soam, as promised, on a matter of some gravity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John Soam now, upon making an effort to retreat out
of the slender orifice which he had left when he nailed
in his board, found his chest and shoulders thicker than
his waist. He wriggled. This being of no avail to extricate
him, he struggled. A convulsion of activity then
seized upon him. He attempted to sit down, he dragged
at himself, he began to do unseemly things. But he could
not get out. He had hammered in his own head and
arms, with many good nails in the board.</p>

<p class='c007'>His friends below him now overheard a sound which,
in a simian, if simians talked at all, would have been a
curse. John wrestled as if demons, expert in catch-as-catch-can,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>were restraining him up there in the attic.
He kicked about, with a violence so great as to overthrow
the barrel whereon he had been standing. For a second
his two blind feet felt about for his whilom support
in an agony of helplessness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goodman Leverett,” he then bawled, in tones of
repressed emotion, “will you put back that barrel for
a moment, till I may come down?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will constrain your legs to seemly conduct,
I will,” said the governor. He and David Donner
having received a kick apiece, now reinstated Goodman
Soam’s pedestal.</p>

<p class='c007'>John became quiescent for a moment. His friends
shifted about, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May we help you in any respect, John?” inquired
Winslow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you fastened in?” added Simon Bradstreet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Might we not pull him down?” suggested Wainsworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends, how many be you?” said the hot, muffled
voice of John.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five,” said one of the solemn governors. “Shall
we give you a little assistance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would only be a little I should want,” said the
carpenter, dropping the nails he had clung to in desperation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The five gentlemen disposed themselves about John’s
anatomy and pulled at his legs with united strength,
grasping the cloth of his trousers for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough! enough!” roared John, after a moment
of hopeless pain and wriggling.</p>

<p class='c007'>His warning came belated. His trousers were of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>good stuff enow, but trousers have their limitations.
They parted, slightly above the uneven line of gripping
hands, and came away in ragged banners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The five citizens were horrified. So was John. Two of
the gentlemen, with the booty taken from their friend,
fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, this was most uncalled for,” said David
Donner.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Soam tried to draw his legs up under his coat,
vainly. He made terrible sounds of anguish, in his
nakedness below and his loneliness up above the ceiling.
His fellow-citizens, undecided as to whether they
should go outside, for the sake of modesty, or remain
and lend further aid to John, looked at one another inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John,” then said Leverett, somewhat sternly,
“would you council us to get an ax and knock out
the board you have hammered into place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” bawled the carpenter, “there be two axes in
the corner. Let them both be employed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have chopped down a tree in my youth,” said
David Donner.</p>

<p class='c007'>He therefore took one of the axes, while Governor
Winslow took the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were then at a loss to reach the ceiling, wherefore
it became necessary for the good men to build up a
platform, of boxes and boards, while John Soam’s legs
tried to hide, one behind the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The platform being hastily constructed, the ax-men
mounted and began to swing ill-directed blows upward
at the stubborn board which the carpenter had hammered
in so thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>No more than three blows had been delivered when
John made protest, howling lustily for the purpose, as
the ax-men failed at first to hear him, while busy with
their work of salvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It jars me rudely,” he roared out, unable wholly to
repress his feelings. “It’s hellish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem,” said Governor Leverett. “What would
you council us to do next, friend Soam?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saw the board,” counseled John. “It was a rare
good fit, but it had best be sawed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The platform was now changed and one after another
the five citizens plied the saw, for the board was wet,
and to saw above one’s head is irksome in a high degree.
Yet at length the cut was made, at one end,
and those below could thrust the imprisoning plank
upward. Being still stoutly nailed at the further end,
the board scraped off some buttons, erstwhile sewn to
John’s waistcoat, and it otherwise harassed him before
it was high enough to permit the carpenter to emerge
from his attic. He appeared at last, however, red of
countenance and in a fine condition to do some private
blaspheming, had the opportunity been present for the
exercise of this, man’s inalienable function. His friends
were immeasurably relieved to see him, safe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend John,” said David Donner, “we have come
hither on matters of state. When you are rehabilitated
we shall, I believe, be glad of your further counsel.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>His</span> friends, forming a hollow square, now escorted
John to the house at a quick walk. He disappeared
like a Jack into its box, when the door was finally
opened, while the grave citizens entered the parlor and
awaited his return. Clothed decorously once more, he
was presently with them again, when the council of
five, with Wainsworth sitting near, drew up to the
heavy, oaken table.</p>

<p class='c007'>They now listened to Governor Winslow, who had
journeyed from Plymouth for this meeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have begun to lose hope,” he said, “that we
shall be able to postpone much longer the day of evil.
We thought our charter was threatened ten or twelve
years ago and we have held it by sheer power of procrastination
and tactics of elusiveness, but Randolph
has been with us here in Boston for seven years, and the
harm he did to our independence in seventy-six has
been accumulating interest in trouble for us, one might
say, ever since. He has mastered our methods; he is
closing in upon us every day. It is now a desperate
case, requiring a desperate remedy. The only question
is, what means can we undertake to offset some of the
ill repute in which he has caused King Charles to hold
us, and to nullify his further machinations.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“It would not be safe, would it, to expel the man
Randolph from the colony?” said Leverett, who had
first coughed behind his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no,” said Donner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such an action would precipitate difficulties with
the King,” added Simon Bradstreet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we would not dare to restrain him from further
evil work?” John Soam inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>His friends shook their heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We know well enough that he has gathered much
testimony from persons willing to swear falsely, as to
the grants to Gorges and Mason, in Maine and New
Hampshire,” said David Donner. “Might we not go
over this same ground and procure true, sworn testimony
and statements from more credible persons, with
which to refute him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would have been well advised seven years ago,”
said Bradstreet, who had a way of tweaking his own
nose when he began to speak, “but at that time we
were still engrossed with, and alarmed by, the war with
King Philip, and moreover we knew nothing of Randolph’s
methods. It would have done well then, but
now it is too late—much too late—for that sort of
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thought upon the matter long and seriously,”
said Winslow. “I can see no way so good as to send
an agent from among ourselves to England, to intercede
with Charles and to plead our cause personally at
the Court, day after day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner knew what was coming. He glared
at an imaginary Stuart family.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Soam said: “I can see the wisdom of such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>course. I consider that when Goodman Simon Bradstreet
went to London before, he did this colony great
service. That was—let me see—why, twenty-three
good long years since. Are you of a mind to go once
more, Friend Simon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am an old man,” said Bradstreet, tweaking his
nose with extra vigor. “A younger wit would be of
far more service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his four score of years on his head Simon Bradstreet
yet did injustice to his immortal youth and
energy. The council knew that it was the gall and
wormwood which he had manfully swallowed, twenty-three
years before, when he went to Charles the Second
to congratulate him upon his restoration to the throne,
that wrought upon him now more than did the infirmities
of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we prove successful in finding an agent from
among us, Friend Soam,” said Winslow, “will you be
one with us to find money for his pilgrimage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And whom would you have in mind?” John
cautiously replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The governors turned with one accord to David
Donner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have asked this service of me,” said David.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leverett said: “There is no one else so free, so
gifted and so bountifully supplied with knowledge of
these colonies. Nor is there any one among us whose
comprehension of the intrigues and artifices employed
by Randolph is so reliable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have none among us more diplomatic and
logical and yet adherent to the cause of truth,” added
Winslow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I feel sure, David, you are the fittest man in
Boston for this important undertaking,” John Soam
said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we could count on you to furnish some of the
necessary funds, if Donner will go, could we not?”
asked Winslow, striking while the Soam iron was hot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may, to be sure,” John responded, more slowly.
“But David has not yet indicated whether he will
undertake this mission or no.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was, indeed, the crucial point. Strict old
Puritan that he was, despiser of ostentations, father
already of that spirit of independence and Americanism
being sown broadcast in New England, David Donner
had already made many a wry face over the prospect
of serving the colony by an expedient so bitter as he
conceived this present task to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have debated this matter, since I had my first intimation
of what to expect from Governor Winslow,”
he said, pursing up his mouth as if he were about to
swallow a brew of hoarhound. “I am not a young
man myself. I may never return to this land. But—if
it is the prompting of your wisdom to send me, I
cannot refuse to serve this colony and these earnest,
toiling people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the joy which his colleagues felt there was no sign
apparent. For that matter, they would be as sad at
losing Donner from their circle as they would be glad
to send him on his mission. Their lives were made up
of joyless duties, woven as a woof through a warp of
joyless worship.</p>

<p class='c007'>But among his hearers there was Wainsworth, and
he was glad, not so much to have the severe old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>going abroad, as to know that Mistress Garde Merrill
would now in all probability remain permanently with
John Soam and his wife, who were good-natured,
affectionate people. Indeed Mrs. Soam was a natural
woman, more delighted when she was fostering or encouraging
a mating, ’twixt youthful hearts, than she
was when kneading dough into loaves that looked like
fat, dimpled babies, and this is saying more than might
readily be supposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus when, soon after, the meeting had broken up
and the Governors had stiffly departed, it was but
natural that Henry should discover, innocently enough,
that he had left a bundle of papers behind. It was
quite as natural, also, that upon returning and purposely
knocking at the door of the family living-room, whereas
the papers should have been still in the parlor, he should
be admitted by Goodwife Soam and asked in most cordially,
and sent with Garde to look for the truant
documents.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>DANGEROUS TRIBUTES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Eloquent</span> as Wainsworth had proved himself, in the
presence of Adam, he was but an indifferent love’s-man,
now that he found himself alone with Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to come back for—for the papers,” he
stammered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Garde, whose spirit of elfishness Henry
always aroused, “they would soon have missed you
sorely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would they—What, papers?—Oh, you are making
fun of——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am making a search to find them,” interrupted
Garde. “Here they are. I am so sorry they have
detained you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you—oh, thank you,” said Henry, still
stumbling confusedly. “It is such a lovely day I
thought I should like to come back and—and—and see—if
I had really left them here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, such a lovely day would make any one wish to
do the same thing,” said Garde, gravely. “Now that
you have them, you must be very happy again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, oh yes—no, no, the papers haven’t made me
happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I am sorry you are sad,” said Garde. “Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the lovely day outside will make you feel more
joyous again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am not sad,” protested Henry, getting momentarily
redder. “I wanted to say—I wanted to
come back——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you did say so, to get the papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—yes!—but I wanted to say——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you had left them, because it was such a
lovely day?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course, but—no, no, I wanted to say—church!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, they are church papers, Mr. Wainsworth?”
asked Garde innocently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I—I wanted to say it is such a lovely day——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have said so many things that you may have
mentioned the day before.” Garde’s eyes were dancing,
but he had hardly dared to look at her face, lest his
tongue should fail him utterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He now fixed his attention on the table with all his
power of will.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to say, if the Sabbath is a lovely day, like
this, may I not walk to meeting with you and David
Donner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Piqued somewhat by the way Adam had treated her,
Garde instantly saw a possible opportunity of arousing
Adam’s jealousy. He would doubtless attend meeting.
He might see her with Henry. As Prudence would
also be there, with her father, there might be further
developments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it is a lovely day, Mr. Wainsworth,” she answered,
“I think Granther Donner will be glad of
your company, but if it is not a lovely day, Granther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and I will have to get along as best we may, alone, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I meant any sort of a day!” cried Wainsworth,
desperately. “If the Sabbath is any sort of a day. I
only said if it was as lovely as to-day because any day,
would be a lovely day, if——” and there he stuck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it were as lovely as to-day,” Garde supplied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Henry, hopelessly. “Then—then that
is settled?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean the weather? It ought to be settled,
I should think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I mean that I am to go with you and David
Donner to meeting, no matter what sort of a day it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think Granther will be glad of your company,”
said Garde again. She led the way back to the living-room
before Henry could frame any more of his tumble-down
speeches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prudence and her mother were both here, now, and
both looked up to smile at Wainsworth, whom they had
grown to like for his evident sincerity. Mrs. Soam
was a pleasant woman, with a double chin from which
it seemed all manner of comfortable little chucklings of
good-nature took their start. She should have been
the mother of several boys, for she liked nice boys and
felt a sense of motherhood over all she knew. Prudence
was not at all like her mother. Her face was
small and serious. She spoke with a quaint drawl.
Although quite as old as Garde, she appeared so unsophisticated
and childish, so quiet and unassertive
that no one would have looked to find womanly emotions,
in her breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Henry,” said Mrs. Soam, who always called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“her boys” by their first names, “how have you been
and what have you been doing? Have you heard from
England recently? How was your mother, when you
heard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She was quite well, thank you,” said Henry, who
could talk to Garde’s aunt without confusion, “but I
have not heard from her recently. Oh—I nearly forgot—I
have heard from England, in a manner. That
is, a friend I knew there, arrived in Boston only yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes? And who was that?” said Mrs. Soam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had started to go up-stairs to her own apartment,
which she shared with Prudence, but she halted
at the door and came back, for Wainsworth said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“His name is Adam Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde and Prudence both took up some knitting and
began to ply the needles, over which their eyes were
bent, intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Soam, encouragingly. “Is he a
Puritan?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Wainsworth, frankly. “I
think perhaps he is. At any rate, he belongs here, I
feel sure. But wherever he belongs, or whatever he is,
he’s a splendid fellow. I was riding to hounds when
we met. My horse threw me, and my foot was caught
in the stirrup. I was being dragged when Rust stopped
my run-away horse. He is one of the most superb horsemen
I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, do you mean that he saved your life?” inquired
Goodwife Soam. “It must have been a terrible
moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t much brains, but I was about to lose what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>I had,” said Wainsworth, generously. “He came in
the nick of time. And afterwards, when I happened to
be a bit short of funds—as a man will, you know,
sometimes—why, he loaned me nearly every penny he
had in the world!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was that not most improvident?” said the listener.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I suppose it was. You know, you wouldn’t
call him exactly provident. He is too good-hearted
a fellow to be that, you know. He is one of those
fellows you can tell anything about yourself. I tell
him everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up at Garde, as he said this, wishing he
could tell her the half that he had confided to Rust.
She never lifted her eyes, however, from her knitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what did he tell you of your mother?” asked
Mrs. Soam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, nothing. He never knew the mater.”
Henry tried to think what Adam had told him. “He
just—well, told me of a few general matters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde listened eagerly, almost breathlessly, dwelling
on every word concerning Rust, but her aunt returned
once more to the subject of Wainsworth’s mother and
no more was heard of Adam, for Henry presently bade
them all good day and proceeded to follow, belated as
he was, where his chief had gone, at the close of the
meeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he disappeared, Garde dropped her knitting
and went quietly up the stairs, for the purpose of being
alone, to think.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>HOURS THAT GROW DARK.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Captain William Phipps</span> was as eager as a boy, now
that he had definitely settled on the purpose which
had for its object the quest of the sunken treasure.
Therefore he and Adam and the beef-eaters worked unceasingly
to prepare the brig, “Captain Spencer,” for
the cruise to the Bahamas.</p>

<p class='c007'>What with provisioning the craft, enlisting more
trustworthy men for the voyage and refitting a somewhat
depleted and inefficient arsenal, Phipps waxed
brusque and impatient. He had desired to get away
from Boston not later than Saturday afternoon, but as
the tasks before them had been tackled by Adam and
the rest of them on Friday morning, the worthy Captain’s
ambition to be on the sea on the Sabbath—a day
for which he had little liking—was vain. Saturday
night therefore approached and Phipps fumed, for he
could not so outrage the Puritans’ sense of things
Godly as to sail on Sunday, wherefore the departure
had perforce to be postponed till Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, with an exaggerated sense of honor, had
resisted the longing to go by night to that same alley in
which he had rescued Garde’s cat and met that young
lady with Mistress Prudence Soam. He spent the time
with his beef-eaters and with Wainsworth, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>merry for these music-hungering friends on the violin,
which now seemed to him more than ever the one thing
left him on which to concentrate the love of his affectionate
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday morning Captain Phipps betook himself
to his brig, as she lay in mid-stream, to pother about
by himself, while Adam dutifully escorted Goodwife
Phipps to meeting, at South Church, which was nearer
than the old church and more popular as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a solemn, black procession of Puritans that
walked decorously to meeting in the sunlight. The
day was one of almost unseemly beauty, for Nature was
fairly barbarous in the colors which she wore like jewels.
There was riotous gladness in the breeze that tipped
back the bonnets from many a pretty face, to let the
sun have a look at peach-bloom cheeks; there was
a deviltry in the warmth that the girls felt first at their
ankles, where thin stockings only protected them; and
there was a twitter and chirrup of birds in the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their homely black and their stiff white collars,
the men were as solemn as posts. No bells sounded,
either from afar, with mellowed pealings, nor nearer
with persistent nagging. Men, women and children
alike walked with their eyes steadfastly fixed on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, there were two pairs of eyes less meek.
They were Adam’s and Garde’s. It therefore came to
pass that each discovered the other, before the church
portals were reached. Garde’s heart began to beat as
if it were knocking to call Adam’s attention. Adam’s
hammered as if it were forging more fetters to bind him
tighter in his love.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Garde, with her grandfather and Wainsworth, preceded
Rust and Mrs. Phipps into the sanctuary. Adam
followed eagerly, and yet as one about to enter a prison.
He had seen Wainsworth, but Henry, in his ecstasy, had
contented himself with looking devotedly at Garde’s
little shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside the church, Garde sat somewhat toward the
back, while Adam, with the men, occupied a bench at
the side of the building from which he could see Mistress
Merrill’s profile perfectly, as often as he dared to
look in her direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, with much resolution, permitted herself not
so much as one tiny flicker of a glance toward Adam,
all during the time of service. She felt him looking at
her, however, from time to time, and rejoiced that her
little ruse to make him stirred up and mayhap jealous
was succeeding. The flush of maidenhood’s beauty
which had mounted to her cheek, the moment she
found that Adam was near, remained throughout the
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later to church than any other, a man, alone, and
none too reverent, entered the door and took a seat
on the side, from which he could scan many of the faces
in the place. It was Randolph. He had come there
for the sole purpose of looking about him, his reasons
being various, but none of them Godly. He shut his
mouth grimly at beholding Adam present, but when his
gaze finally rested on Garde, all the more radiantly
beautiful for the simplicity of her dress, it became fixed,
first, then covetous, and finally passionate.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until the meeting was finished that Garde
ventured to take a sly glance at Adam. Her gaze met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>his. She saw and comprehended, then, such a fathomless
sadness in his look, before he could drop his gaze,
that she was instantly most penitent over what she had
done.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the same look she had seen in his eyes that
day when he had marched as a captive, at the end of
King Philip’s war—a look she never had, and never
could, forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Rust, he had confirmed to his satisfaction, all
that Wainsworth had told him. If he had not been
convinced before and ready to renounce his own hopes,
he was quite persuaded and determined now. He
thought how fortunate it was that Phipps had the brig
all ready to sail on the morrow. It was very much better
to end the matter with the smallest possible delay.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spent the afternoon with Phipps and the beef-eaters
on the ship. To his credit, he made himself an
agreeable and cheerful companion. Indeed, what with
the songs he had sung for Wainsworth and the others,
and the spirit of his raillery, boasting and readiness to
fight or to fiddle, he had succeeded in deceiving them
all as to the nature under his waistcoat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet when the night was come and the magnet which
had been drawing and drawing him to that alley, sacred
to the memory of Garde’s cat, once more exercised its
influence, more powerfully than ever, he became a
restless creature.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that man justifies himself in whatsoever
he does. Adam thought he needed justification
for desiring to go once, just once, into that alley,
wherefore he prepared his mind with several excuses.
Armed with these he at length slipped away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Crow and Arrow and found his way to the rear of
that house into which he had seen Garde and Prudence
disappear, on that memorable first night in
Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had Rust come to this trysting-place at the same
hour on the two previous evenings, he would have met
Mistress Merrill face to face. Garde, in her impulsive
eagerness to see him again, had waited for little debating
before she slipped from the house, to see if he
might not have come to deliver that certain trinket
from Hispaniola. Her cousin Prudence, more diffident,
had desired to come forth also, but she had
lacked Garde’s readiness of execution and courage.
However she had not lacked the incentive, and as no
maiden is utterly awed, in the presence of a tender
passion, Mistress Prudence had at length steeled her
heart, and to-night she came tripping diffidently forth,
not long after Adam’s arrival on the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>So silently had Prudence come that Adam, who
might have arranged otherwise, suddenly found himself
confronted, before he had made up his mind whether
he wished any one might appear or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, good evening, Mr. Rust,” said Prudence,
with a little gasp at her own daring, “why, I was just
walking in the garden and couldn’t think who it might
be, here by the gate. Why, how strange we should
meet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had said good evening, waving a salute grandly
with his hat, the moment Prudence had spoken, for he
had realized instantly that she was not Garde and his
presence of mind had risen to the occasion without
delay.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I—wandered up here looking, for—for distressed
cats,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, did you?” said Prudence, innocently. “That
was real noble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam hated to have anything he did called noble.
He therefore hastened to do penance, in a measure, for
his slightly inaccurate statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am bound to confess,” he added, “that I did
have a faint hope that I might see either you or Mistress
Merrill—or both—to say good-by, for to-morrow I am
off again, for a jaunt on the sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Going away?” echoed Prudence. “Oh, why,
Garde might be disappointed, not to see you and say
good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam thought this was sweet of Prudence, as indeed
it was. He could have mentioned some disappointments
himself, but he refrained from doing so. He
thought, in a somewhat bitterly philosophical vein, that
perhaps it was better as it was, better that he should
not see Garde again, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very kind,” he said. “Perhaps it would
not be asking too much of you to get you to take a
small packet—in fact, I have presumed to provide myself
with two little packages, which I trust you and
Mistress Merrill will receive, merely as tokens of a
rover’s amusement in the little event of a few evenings
ago, and of a pleasant memory which the episode will
furnish for otherwise lonely moments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had indeed made up two small parcels, intending
behind the ruse of making a small gift to both Garde
and Prudence, to bestow thus the present to Garde
brought from Hispaniola and long delayed as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>delivery. He therefore took these carefully wrapped
trinkets from his pocket and held them forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I might prevail upon your good nature,” he said,
“to accept this one and to give this other into the
hands of Mistress Merrill, I should be grateful to you
for the favor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fate takes obvious delight in making her weavings
complete. It was inevitable that Garde should come
out to that garden gate, while Adam and Prudence
were talking there together, and that she should therefore
see Adam, presenting something to her cousin,
and should at once proceed to place an erroneous construction
on the situation. Angered, humiliated and
hurt, she fled back to the house, as Prudence was accepting
the proffered trinkets and regretfully bidding
Adam Rust good-by.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was hardly feasible so to conceal herself in the
house that Prudence would be long in searching her
out, when at length that quiet and pleased young lady
came back to the house, hence Garde accepted Adam’s
present before she exactly comprehended what she was
doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prudence, having performed her duty, when the gift
had passed to its rightful owner, hastened away to open
her own packet, in privacy. She found an old Spanish
doubloon in the bit of paper, and though a trifle disappointed
that she did not discover an accompanying
inscription, was nevertheless gladdened to the very core
of her being.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, rebellious and ready to weep with conflicting
emotions, which had not been assuaged by hearing
Prudence tell how innocently she had happened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>meet Mr. Rust, felt like flinging Adam’s gift upon the
floor and stamping it flat with her lively little foot.
But the tenderness of the love she had fostered so long,
and the slight hope to which she still clung, combined
with her natural curiosity, proved too strong for resistance.
She opened the neatly tied and folded paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside was a golden brooch of exquisite workmanship,
a treasure absolutely irresistible to any beauty-loving
young woman. But her gaze flew to a secondary
little wad of paper, folded as a note. This she tore
open with nerveless fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From Hispaniola,” Adam had written, simply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this he had penned a quatrain of rather obscure
meaning and weakly versification:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It always haps, when there are three,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But two can bide in unity;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That two may long their gladness keep,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The third should bury sorrow deep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Garde read these lines and then read them again,
more puzzled by the second perusal than she had been
by the first. She began then to feel wounded. She
was ready to cry. The brooch had made her heart
bound with joy. Then she remembered that Adam
had procured it for her years before, since when his
affections might have been transferred, his ideals might
have been altered and the sense in which he gave it
her might have been reduced to something utterly unromantic.
He might indeed have given it to her only
because of his desire to keep a foolish promise made in
his boyhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lines were not an explanation of his conduct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>If they meant that she was a third party, interfering
with the happiness of himself and Prudence, then the
unkindness of it all was not the full depth of its possibilities—it
was impudent, arrogant and fairly hateful,
in that light.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, could it be possible that Adam
did not mean that she was such a third party as the
lines indicated, and if so, what did he mean? Was he
himself such a third party? This appeared impossible
on the very face of it, for not only was Garde not
interested in, and happy with, some other person, but
if she had been, Adam could not possibly have known
it, and certainly, in the two times they had met, she had
given him no reason for supposing that anything of the
sort could exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was too much for her wearied brain to cope with.
She had puzzled over Adam’s conduct every moment
since their meeting in the woods, till she could think
no more. There was the beautiful brooch, and here
were these ominous, enigmatical lines. All she knew
was that she was very unhappy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, in the meantime, made progress back to the
tavern as if he were all but becalmed and had no more
than steerage way at the best. He had only one thing
to be glad about, and that was that his beef-eaters
would not be at the Crow and Arrow to meet him.
They had already taken up quarters on the brig.
There Adam expected to join them, with the last of
his worldly goods, when he should have taken final
leave of Wainsworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he reached his solitary apartments, however,
he was sorry the faithful old beef-eaters were not there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to give him welcome, for the place was dark and cheerless.
He lighted his candle and looked about the
room with melancholy interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently his attention was attracted to a number of
bright spots on the floor, irregular patches, from which
the light was reflected somewhat dully. Candle in
hand he walked toward the corner where these glittering
objects were strewn about. With a sudden misgiving
he noted that his violin case had been brought
out from the place of concealment in which he had
carefully kept it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bending forward, with one hand poised in an attitude
of arrested action, he stared at the litter on the
floor, his face becoming colorless as he stood there,
numbed. A low moan came from between his lips—such
a sound as he had made in his sleep, as he once
lay curled up at the foot of the stake on which King
Philip’s head was impaled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fragments on the floor were the scraps and
litter of his violin. There was not one piece as large
as three of his fingers. Isaiah Pinchbecker and Psalms
Higgler had taken their revenge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slowly Adam knelt down and gathered the bits of
wood in a little heap, lovingly. He was not enraged.
A lover who finds his sweetheart murdered cannot at
first be filled with anger. Adam gathered every little
scrap and splinter. He tried to fit little fragments
together; he tried to efface heel-marks and bits of
boot-grime from some of the pieces, as if he searched
for features which he loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed as if he could not realize that the violin
was actually destroyed. He looked away from it and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>then back at the small heap beneath his hands, like
one half expecting to wake from a dream and find
everything as it had been before something unthinkable
occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps a woman who had given to her child, willingly
and absolutely, the mastery over her every emotion,
thought and hope, and who had come upon the
body of that child, slain and mutilated, could have
understood what lonely Adam Rust underwent.</p>

<p class='c007'>For like such a woman, conceiving a fear that the
despoilers might return and rob her even of the body
of her child, the man presently, in a fever of excitement,
took every patch, shred and chip of the red wood
and hiding it carefully inside his waistcoat, dropped
himself down from the window to the earth and went
away in the darkness, like a wild thing pursued.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A KISS DEFERRED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Garde</span>, when she had questioned her cousin Prudence,
until there was little or nothing concerning
Adam’s visit and farewell at the gate which she did not
know, was still far from being certain of anything in
connection with the whole predicament.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing, however, gave her a small measure of
comfort. This was that her brooch was much more
beautiful than the Spanish doubloon Adam had given
to Prudence. Yet this comfort grew cold as she reflected
that even if Adam did possibly like her as much
as he did Prudence, he had written her those incomprehensible
lines about burying sorrow, and he had
gone away, she knew not where, or in what manner,
without even giving her an opportunity of bidding him
God-speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mistress Merrill was not impulsive and nimble-witted
without having resources at command, when occasion
demanded. She was up ahead of the ordinary lark, on
Monday morning, making straight for the home of old
Goody Dune, for whom she frequently gathered
simples.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody Dune had not contented herself in life with
simples only. She had gathered complexities of wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and the things abstruse in life, for many a year. She
was a wrinkled old woman whom children, kittens,
dogs, horses and all things guided by instinct always
sought in friendship at once. Anyone with patience
enough to reconstruct her face on the lines it must
once have worn, in her youth, would have found personal
beauty still indicated in the old woman’s countenance.
Her eyes still ensnared pretty lights of humor;
her lips were still of that soft texture which in youth
is so charming and in old age too flexible over vacancies
where teeth are gone. Her hair was plentiful and so
entirely gray that one might have looked at it closely
and then have said: “Yes, the black ones seem to be
coming; they will soon be getting quite thick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Never yet had Garde been able to get to Goody’s
house sufficiently early to knock on the door. Goody
always opened it to receive her. And always the old
woman’s great black cat stood up, on top of the tall
clock, on which she had been lying but the moment
before, now arching her back and stretching, to add
her welcome to that of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room never had ceased to have its fascinations
for Garde, since the first time she had seen it, in her
childhood. The small bags, which hung from the
rafters, along with pendants made of herbs, roots and
bulbs, might have contained gold and precious gems,
for all that Garde knew to the contrary, while the dark
cupboard and the great chest increased the possibilities
of the place, which would have been so grand to rummage
in, had it not been for the brass warming-pan, so
terribly like a watchful moon, forever looking down
from the wall. Then lastly, and mostly, in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>particulars, there was Rex, the jackdaw, a veritable
concentration of all the dark arts and wisdoms extant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning, my dear,” said Goody, as Garde
entered, breathless with her haste, “you have come to
see me early.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s in love,” said the jackdaw, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, dear me!” gasped the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rex, you wicked one,” expostulated Goody, mildly.
“Never mind, my dear, he found you out that morning
last week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the truth for Goody had said these very
same words, several times, in the presence of Rex, no
more than five minutes after Garde had gone, that day
when she and Adam had met in the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I—oh, Goody, Rex is really wicked,” said
Garde. “But I do so need you to tell me something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who doesn’t,” answered Goody. “What a pity it
would be if I could never save anyone in the world
from some little pain, or some mistake, and yet”—she
shook her head, smiling half sadly—“how few
human beings are willing even to listen. They must
all burn their fingers and learn for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fools!” said the jackdaw, “fools, fools, fools.
I’m a fool myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately Garde was not unaccustomed to these
interruptions on the part of the knowing bird, so that,
although he always made her pause and look at him,
as if she expected to see how he did it, when he spoke,
she was now enabled to tell Goody her troubles with
quite as much rapidity as coherence.</p>

<p class='c007'>She held back nothing. She told all about her
original glimpse of Adam in the Plymouth procession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of their meeting, her immediate regard for him, then
and there, the long fostering of her affection, and the
events of the days just past. This done, she produced
her slip of paper, on which Adam had written his
mediocre verse, and laid it before the wise woman to
be deciphered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody read the lines several times. “How old are
you now, my dear?” she asked, and then she added,
“It hasn’t anything to do with your worries; it is only
for my own foolish gratification that I ask.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am eighteen,” said Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I should have been puzzled myself, at eighteen,”
said the old woman. She looked into vacancy,
for a moment, dwelling on some fond memory that
brought her sad smile to her withered lips again.
“But you need not be worried. He loves you, dear,
as indeed he should, but for some reason or other he
believes you care for somebody else, and he is therefore
taking himself away. Believing as he does, he is certainly
right, as well as brave, in going away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t love—like any one else,” protested
Garde. “And I don’t see how or why he ever got
such an idea into his head. He doesn’t know anybody
that I know. He went to meeting with Mrs. Phipps—Oh!
oh—Mr. Wainsworth!—He does know Mr. Wainsworth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dearie, and does Mr. Wainsworth seem to
fancy you, or anything of that sort?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Mr. Wainsworth told us he had seen Adam,
and that he told him everything,” said Garde, thinking
for herself and musing aloud. “Oh, dear me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, dear me!” said Rex, derisively.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“And do you know where your Adam is going, and
when?” inquired Goody. “Those ought to be your
main considerations now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, to-day,” answered Garde. “But I don’t
know where, or anything else about it. What shall I
do? If he goes away like that, I may never see him
again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you say he went to meeting with Goodwife
Phipps?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,—yes, I saw him myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you can be almost certain that he is off somewhere
with Captain William Phipps, for a more restless,
sea-hankering man never lived and remained so
good as Captain Phipps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I might have thought of that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you ought to be able to think of something
to do this very morning,” said Goody, a little, pretty
color burning up in her wrinkled cheeks. “It is still
early, and you have good stout legs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde suddenly jumped up and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by!” she said. “Oh, thank you, thank
you, so much! But—haven’t you something I can
take to—to Captain Phipps?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody immediately supplied her with a small package.
“Take him this tea,” she said. “No sailor
should ever go to sea without it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde sped away, as if on the wings of impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s in love! she’s in love!” screamed the jackdaw,
hilariously. As she ran, Garde could hear him
clapping his wings against his body, in noisy applauding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Running and walking alternately, by the quieter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>streets and lanes, meeting no one on her way, Garde
finally arrived in sight of the ship-yard belonging to William
Phipps. Her first impulsive thought had by now
had time to abate somewhat and give place to a more
sober reflection. Mistress Merrill began to wonder
what she would say, if she did manage to see Adam
Rust. It had been by a swift inspiration, almost an
instinct of a maidenly young woman, that she had
provided herself with an excuse for racing to this place.
No modest girl could bear the thought of seeming to
run after a man, or to say anything bold to him, or
anything calculated to show that she held herself in
any way other than proudly aloof, where he must bring
his love, if he would sue for her favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought of all this as she went. She also began
to think that perhaps Goody Dune might be mistaken.
If Adam were found and he did not love her after all,
not for all the world would he get one sign from her
that she loved him or cared for him one tiny bit, or
cared whether he went or remained.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was breathless, rosy as a cherry and excited.
Her hair had fallen down and the plaits had loosened.
It hung about her face and nestled against her creamy
throat like strands of ebony, richly copper-plated. Her
dark eyes were flashing; her lips were parted, revealing
her teeth like little white soldiers in a row. As she
ran, her skirts whipped upward, in curves, about the
roundest and trimmest ankles imaginable.</p>

<p class='c007'>She now observed a small boat, approaching the
landing. Out in the stream the sails of the “Captain
Spencer” were rising like clouds. Garde then discovered
the figure of a tall man, who had been sitting on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>heap of logs, for he arose and went toward the dory,
which had evidently come from the ship to fetch him.
She recognized familiar outlines and the drag of the
sword which the man was wearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam!” she cried. “Oh, Adam, wait!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But she was still too far away to be heard. Adam
continued leisurely walking toward the landing. Then
the sailor who had rowed ashore for Rust, saw the picturesque
figure coming toward them so swiftly, and
pointed her out to Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust was puzzled for a moment. Then he knew it
was Garde. His heart turned a double somersault in
his breast. He felt himself grow red to the tips of his
ears. He walked toward the girl as one uncertain of
what is expected of him next.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde stopped running, when some distance away,
and came on more slowly, brushing a wisp of hair from
her face. Suddenly afraid of what she had done, uncertain
of what she would or could say, to explain her
presence so that he would think no less of her than before,
she was glad he had not heard her call out his
name, but she was tremendously excited. Her eyes
shone like brown jewels. Her bosom was heaving
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—good morning, Mistress Merrill,” said
Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh—it is you—Mr. Rust!” said Garde, in the
surprise which a woman can feign on a second’s notice.
“Why, I thought—why, good morning. I thought I
might find Captain Phipps here, and Goody Dune
wished me to give him this tea, and she heard—she
heard he was going away this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Oh! thank you, very much,” said Adam, a little
thickly, in his tremendous excitement, which he was
endeavoring to restrain. “Goody Dune was very
thoughtful, and you were kind to come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Goody didn’t tell me I should find you here,”
said Garde, truthfully enough. She had never felt so
stirred in her life. But outwardly she was beginning
to be calm. “You told Prudence you were going
away. Can it be possible that you are going with Captain
Phipps?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, this morning,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there was a silence for a moment. Garde
hardly knew what to say next. If she should make the
slightest advance and he should receive it coldly, or
derisively, or without understanding, she would die of
mortification. The pause became dreadful to bear—to
them both.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I got—Prudence gave me the brooch—from Hispaniola,”
Garde stammered, presently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam saw it. It was rising and falling like a little
golden ship, on her bosom. He felt himself somewhat
at sea. If he could only have blurted out that he loved
her—if it had not been for Wainsworth, what a moment
this would have been!</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad you like it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde felt that there was little encouragement in
this remark. “You will not forget to give the tea to
Captain Phipps, will you?” she said. “I think I must
now return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you had brought this tea down here for
me!” said Rust suddenly, no longer answerable to his
loyalty to Wainsworth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Garde had wished he would say these very words.
She had rehearsed the answer she would make if he did.
Her heart, had it been a bird beating its wings, could
not have fluttered more wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I had come down here to see you, it would only
have been to tell you that you have made some mistake,”
she said, averting her gaze from his and looking
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam trembled, uncontrollably, violently. She saw
it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean——” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Garde, raising her eyes to his frankly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I can love you! I do love you! I’ll come
back here and marry you, sweetheart! I shall love you
and tell you I love you and love you!” he burst forth
passionately. “My little Garde! my love! my sweetheart!—my
little wife that I shall have and love till my
heart is full!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde gasped for breath in the whirlwind of his
words, that swept her fairly off her feet. Her hand
had been on a post, where she had been picking away
little particles of bark. Adam took it. His big hand
encompassed it all about. She felt his soul rush to his
fingers, to meet the throbbing of her own emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam!” was all she could say for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde!” he replied, “my Garde—my love! Why
didn’t you tell me about it before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you were the one,” she said, somewhat regaining
her footing. “You were going away without
even saying good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you thought such silly things,” interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Garde, impulsively, yet joyfully. “You thought I
could like somebody else, and that is why you were going
away—without even asking. And I don’t know
why you ever came to see me the first time and made
me name my cat Standing-Panther, if you were going
to think such things as that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam laughed. It was a sudden bubbling over of
his spirits. He was the bright-eyed, joyous boy again,
all at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Henry—poor Henry!” he said, with irrepressible
mirth and gladness. “But he never loved you as
I love you, sweetheart! He couldn’t! I love you so
that I would cut down an army to get you and run away
with you here in my arms though all the demons of
earth should follow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh but, Adam—you mustn’t!” said Garde, as Rust
was about to demonstrate the ardor of which he had
spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, sweetheart, not one little kiss?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, no, of course not, Adam,” she answered him,
blushing prettily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t we betrothed?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not said I will marry you, have I, Adam?”
she said, roguishly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you shall, sweetheart. I love you so much
that you can’t help it! I love you so it seems as if I
shall explode! I love you, dear! Do you hear me say
it? I love you! I love you, Garde. You do love me,
sweetheart—just a little?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I—love you a lit——,” Garde was saying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A-d-a-m R-u-s-t.——come—aboard!” came a great
voice across the harbor, from the brig out in the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Beg pardon, sir, the Capting’s calling,” shouted
the sailor, who had rowed ashore for Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam waved him a dumb reply. “Then you will
give me one little kiss, for good-by, sweetheart?” he
begged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—it’s too soon,” said Garde. “Besides——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am going away,” interrupted Adam. “And
I have loved you seven years!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you are not going away now—not now, when
we have just found out there was some mistake?” said
Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have promised to go, and therefore I must,” said
Adam. “And I have to go and get that fortune now,
so that I can come back and marry you, sweetheart! I
must keep my promise to Captain Phipps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you won’t stay away for seven years again, will
you, Adam?” inquired Garde, looking at him wistfully
and candidly now, with all her love in her eyes. “If
you do——” she left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I will not,” Adam assured her. “But if I remained
away for fifty years, I should love you and love
you still. And will you love me, dearest, as long as
that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I shall love you longer than that,” answered
Garde. She was not impulsive now, but her manner
was sweetly earnest, therefore it was more beautiful
than all her other beauty. “I shall always love you
now, Adam,” she added. “It seems to me as if I always
had.”</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps roared across the water once again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam’s less tumultuous, more enduring love, came
into his eyes. He thought the caress of her long look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>was sweeter than the kiss Garde might have given
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall have to go,” he murmured. “God bless
you and keep you, sweetheart. Good-by, dear Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, Adam,” said Garde. “I shall pray for
your swift return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He swept her little hand to his lips for a second and
then strode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde placed her other hand over the tingling fingers
he had kissed, as if to prevent the caress from escaping.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he went out over the water, she waved her tiny
handkerchief to him, and permitted two warm tears to
trickle down her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam’s memory of her was of her pretty, brown figure,
seen from afar, and the look in her eyes, which he
felt that no space could dim in his vision.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>OVERTURES FROM THE ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Against</span> his long journey across the Atlantic, David
Donner made preparations that consumed no small
amount of time. A sufficient quantity of money had
been subscribed by the patriots who were so concerned
for the charter, but this was one of the least important
details of Donner’s contemplated venture. As a matter
of fact, the Puritans had acquired the arts of procrastination
patiently and laboriously, for this had proved
their most efficient weapon of defense, in those days of
struggling against the Stuart dynasty, and therefore
the cream of the putting-off science permeated the very
being of David Donner. He nursed his preparations
till they grew and flourished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two ships bound for England sailed without him.
He was quite calm as he contemplated further events
of a like nature. At length his fellow-citizens, eager
to have him at his work, expostulated with him, mildly.
His answer astounded them all. He said he had reasons
for believing that Edward Randolph was beginning to
feel inclined toward more kindliness of spirit with
regard to the Colony and the men who had built it
there in the wilderness. Randolph had made overtures
of friendship to him. He appeared to be a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>agreeable person than any one of them had heretofore
believed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph, indeed, was fairly wooing the old man’s
regard. He had begun by nodding, pleasantly, when
he and Donner passed in the streets. He had followed
this up by halting at Donner’s gate and admiring his
flowers, for which the old man had a secret passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could dissuade him from his evil purposes,”
said David to his colleagues, “if I could win his favor
for the charter, and so enlist his services with us,
instead of against us, I should be of vastly more service
to Massachusetts by remaining here than I could be if
I were to go to the Court of Charles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless the governors held the promise of David
Donner sacred. He would go as agreed, unless he
could shortly furnish something substantial as a result
of this coy flirtation of Randolph’s to gain his good
opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been observed that Randolph had been a regular
attendant at South Church for several Sundays.
This new departure of his had been at first regarded
with suspicion. Coupled with his attention to David,
however, it began to look honest and therefore hopeful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grandfather Donner was pothering about in his
garden, on one of these mornings, when Randolph
paused at the gate, as he had frequently done, and
asked leave of the old man to present him with a small
rose-tree, having even then a beautiful rose upon it, to
plant in some sunny corner of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>No olive branch of peace could have opened Donner’s
heart more effectually than did this simple matter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Come in, friend,” said he. “Come in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has always seemed a pity to me,” said Randolph,
“that men whose political ideas may happen to differ
should not be friendly in other particulars, with no
more thought of their daily affairs than they would
have of the clothing upon their backs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just so,” said David, who thought the time propitious
for missionary work at home, “but I should
think, however, that with your youth and earnestness
you might have a great future before you, as one of us,
working as we work, hoping as we hope, and helping to
build this new commonwealth on a rock of solidity and
unity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thought of that,” said the heavy-browed
visitor. “But how would a man proceed to accomplish
a result so remote from one like myself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you plant it here, or next to the wall?”
said David, holding the rose-tree in his hand and looking
about for a suitable place in which to tuck its
roots.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would plant it here, by all means,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner began to dig in the earth with a knife.
“Well,” said he, “I should say you would do best to
get married and adopt our ways, and labor with us to
maintain our government and rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph’s deep-set eyes gleamed with satisfaction.
He said: “You may not be surprised to know that I
have had such an ambition as this. Could I look for
your encouragement and support, if I entertained the
idea of marrying, here among your people, and making
my life with your lives?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Why, to be sure, friend. I would be the first to
welcome the attachment of your heart and your interests
among us. And have you looked with favor upon
some one of our young women?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph noted with pleasure that the rose-tree was
firmly planted and the earth about it patted and pressed
down almost affectionately. “It would hardly be fair,”
he said, “to give one flower, only to ask for another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you have some of my poor flowers?” said
the old man, innocently. “Why you shall, then, anything
you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I spoke of my hopes that I have dared to entertain,”
said the visitor. “I referred to the fairest flower in all
Boston, indeed in all Massachusetts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner looked up at him quickly. He rose to his
feet, having been down on one knee to plant the rose.
“Have I understood you aright?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has slipped from my tongue unguardedly,” said
the younger man. “Your encouragement of my hopes
led me to this confidence. But I feel I can speak to
you almost as if you were in the attitude of a father.
I can come to you where I could not come to any other
man in Boston. I have seen Mistress Merrill, in the
simplicity and piety of her life, and this has made me
wish to become one of you, working with you and living
your lives. Can you not encourage me so far as this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner was all but rendered speechless. Such
a thought as that Garde had grown up and blossomed had
never entered his mind. But not only to find that this
was so, but also to have Edward Randolph—the enemy—desiring
this alliance, this was more than he could
think of, for a moment. He had egged the man on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>while he had some vague idea of some other young
woman in mind—some other man’s daughter, or granddaughter,—he
had been ready to abet such an arrangement,
gladly, for the good of the colony, but to find
that it was Garde that Randolph wanted—this was
indeed a bolt from a clear sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” he said, finally, “I shall have to think
this over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feared it would sound abrupt,” said the visitor,
“yet it is not a sudden fancy with me. It has been
my constant thought for many weeks. I have even
foreseen difficulties. I have worked so many years
apparently against the interests most dear to the
colonists.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner nodded at him, for this sounded frank. But
the old man’s thoughts were afield, wandering, for the
proposition came home to him with tremendous significance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” resumed Randolph, “any man can conceive
that an agent must do, to the best of his ability, that
which he honestly believes to be his duty, howsoever
unpleasant the task imposed upon him may finally appear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True,” said David, still vaguely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have done my work as well as I could,” the man
went on. “I have accumulated matter of vast significance.
I am almost sorry that I have done so thoroughly
well, the task appointed me, and still all this work
might make me the better fitted for citizenship among
you, if I follow out your suggestion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner was not insensible of the threat which this
artful speech implied, the threat that all this accumulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>matter and knowledge would be used against
the colony and the charter, if this man were not made
one of their number. But Garde was not to be lightly
weighed in the balance. Randolph’s frankness partially
disarmed the old man; and the life of the charter, he
felt, was the life of their independence, their manhood,
their very being. The tiny roots and tendrils of American
patriotism grew from the very hearts of those
early fathers of liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a matter which would much concern
Mistress Merrill,” said Donner. “I made the error of
trying to coerce her mother. I shall never coerce
Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust not,” replied his guest. “And yet I hope
you will think upon the matter and mayhap speak to
Mistress Merrill in this regard, for although I am in a
conflict, ’twixt my duty to my King and the high regard
which I have been constrained to place with you
and your people, through Mistress Merrill, yet I fear
I am eager to be remiss with Charles, rather than a
traitor to my own heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will think upon it,” said David, slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph thanked him, spoke of the rose again and
went his way. He was a gardener himself, and having
planted his seed, knew enough not to dig it up to see if
it had yet begun to sprout.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner sat down to think, not of Garde and not
of all that Randolph’s visit signified, but of Garde’s
mother and his harshness when her heart had burgeoned
with aspirations for itself, and of the pain and wretchedness
he had brought to all concerned. He thought of
the mad little elopement into which he had driven his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>daughter, which had ended so disastrously to the honest
but poverty-overtaken father of her child. Then he
thought of the home-coming, the birth of Garde and
the death of the forlorn little mother. He could hear
again her faint words of forgiveness; he could see again
her wan smile on her faded lips; he could still feel the
weak, white hands that raised to slip themselves about
his neck and which, when he had put them down, he
folded on her breast, still forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have never coerced little Garde,” he said aloud,
“never, Ruth, never.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LOVE’S INVITING LIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Something</span> had happened to Mistress Garde Merrill,
even as far back as upon that first Sunday at Meeting,
when Adam had been beneath the South Church roof,
where she could see him from the corners of her eyes.
Love had left its sign-manual upon her. She had
suddenly become illumined from within, by her heart’s
emotions, so that she appeared to shine from afar, in
the somewhat gray and unjoyous lives of the Puritan
young men about her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it was that, in addition to Randolph, who attended
the service solely for the purpose of feasting his
eyes upon her beauty, there was always Wainsworth,
who heard nothing of the Meeting’s cheerless proceedings.
And there was also young Piety Tootbaker, who
knew not at which shrine he was worshiping, from
Sunday to Sunday.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was half the time at her uncle, John Soam’s.
This fact increased the facilities for the young men to
seek her presence, for the Soams were life-loving people,
in spite of their Puritan conformity to the somewhat
melancholy and smileless practices of the day. Moreover,
John Soam, who thought himself something of a
farmer, as well as a carpenter and Jack-of-all-genius,
not infrequently impressed the would-be suitors into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>various duties with which he was amusing himself about
his place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Piety Tootbaker was a fat young man of modest wealth
in his own right, his father having died leaving Piety
his sole heir. He was a heavy lump, who came often
and said next to nothing, so that his intentions might
have lain anywhere between Prudence, Garde and the
family cow, for aught that any one could ascertain
definitely. He was John Soam’s easiest prey, when the
farmer or carpenter, as the case might be, was seized
with a desire to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph contented himself with courting David
Donner. He felt no small contempt for Wainsworth
and Tootbaker, whose movements he was stealthily
watching. He had placed his reliance on power always,
and with complete success. The present was no time
to alter his usual tactics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grandfather Donner, left alone with his thoughts,
arrived at no conclusions rashly. He went systematically
to work on his friends, to get from each an expression
of belief that Randolph, if he would become
one of them, working for instead of against them,
would be a valuable factor for the preservation of the
charter. This opinion he readily secured, especially as
he gave no hint, as yet, of the method by which Randolph’s
conversion was finally to be accomplished.
Indeed so much promise could his friends discern in the
securing of an end so commendable, that David Donner
began to justify himself in the thought of aiding this
matter with all reasonable power. He encouraged
the growth of a better opinion of Randolph, in his own
mind. He argued the man’s case with his friends, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fanatical insistence, until they perforce admitted virtues
in Randolph’s disposition, heretofore quite overlooked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus he wrought upon himself until, mentally, he
accepted the ex-enemy as his grandson-in-law, to whom
he was willing to extend his welcome, if not actually his
love. With this development of the case, his dislike
for the journey to England increased, while, far from
abating, his concern for the charter grew the more
active, as he dreamed of preserving it here at his own
home.</p>

<p class='c007'>His state of mind was not a thing at which he arrived
immaturely. The proposition had come to him with
something of a shock. He had never contemplated
Garde’s marriage at all. She was still a child to him,
or at least, she had been, up to the moment when
Randolph spoke. Not the least difficult of his tasks
with himself had been that of compelling himself to
admit that Garde had actually arrived at the threshold
of womanhood—that she was marriageable. This having
been finally accomplished, Randolph had half won
his battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as Garde would presently desire to marry, then
why not Randolph, especially as such an alliance would
be of such tremendous political significance? Yet he
continued still to tell himself that Ruth’s child should
not be coerced in any direction whither she was not
counseled by her heart and her own inclination to proceed.
He could see no reason, however, why she should
entertain any notions which might be at variance with
his own. Nevertheless it was not without emotion
that he finally summoned Garde to the interview in
which he meant to broach the proposition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“My child,” he began, “I have desired to have a
talk with you, which bears upon matters of some
importance to you and of vast significance to the
state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Grandther,” said Garde dutifully, and she sat
down with her knitting. “I suppose you are going to
England at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That remains to be seen,” said David. “The need
for something to be done is great. No loyal soul in all
our commonwealth could wish for aught but a chance
to serve this colony in her present straits. Have you
great love for Massachusetts and her people, Garde?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not love a passion?” she answered, without raising
her eyes from her work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Love of one’s country is not an unseemly passion,”
said her grandfather.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I have for Massachusetts a seemly regard,”
said Mistress Merrill, who had given all her love elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And could you sacrifice somewhat of your personal
thoughts, and mayhap desires, for the colony? Could
you be a little patriot in the hour of your country’s
need, my child?” asked the old man, his look intent
upon her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde thought he doubtless referred to his projected
trip abroad. She was inclined to believe that she could
endure the personal sacrifice of living with the Soams
during his absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should try to be dutiful,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner felt his old heart knocking on his ribs.
It was a moment of much intensity for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have always been a dutiful daughter,” he said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Have you ever had a thought, child, of the womanhood
come upon you, and that mayhap you will one day
become a wife now, and be as other women, a child no
longer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any young woman would think on these matters
by nature,” replied Garde, sagely. “But I have
thought of nothing to occur soon, as to such a matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, to be sure,” said David, nervously. “Yet
I have desired to speak with you upon this subject, for
an estimable young man has asked me to do this in his
favor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, who had believed his thought anywhere but
here, looked up at him quickly. She saw the old man’s
face drawn and eager, his eyes bright with the flame of
incipient fanaticism. She was wholly at a loss to understand
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A young man?” she repeated. “Some one has
spoken to you thus of me?” For a moment her
thought ran wildly to Adam. Could it be possible that
he had returned and spoken to Grandther Donner
already?</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner cleared his throat. He was pale, for he had
not come to this moment without some violence to his
own conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child,” he said, a little huskily, “a great opportunity
is offered to you to render a vast service to your
country—to Massachusetts. Edward Randolph, who
has long been against us, has come to me with an earnest
desire to become one of us, working with us and not
against us longer, and asking your hand in marriage,
to cement the unity of his interests and hopes with
ours. He appears to be an earnest, sincere man, at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>heartily in sympathy with our struggles, and worthy of
good citizenship among us. I have told him I would
speak to you upon this matter, Garde, and take him
your answer.” He paused and mopped his forehead
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde could hardly believe her ears. She looked at
her grandfather oddly. The color left her cheeks, for
a moment, only to rush back in a flood at thought of
Adam and the betrothal, to her so sacred. She had no
thought whatsoever, during that interval, of the colony,
or of patriotism, or of anything save what this proposition
meant to Adam and to her. As for Randolph, she
know him only by sight, and her instinct had prompted
her to shun him, if not to loathe him. Her impulse
was to start to her feet and cry out a shrill repudiation
of the man’s offer. But the sight of Donner’s face
awed her. She had never seen him look like this before.
She remained seated. She resumed her knitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I do not even know Mr. Randolph,” she said,
mildly. “I have not been taught to trust or to respect
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if we have done him injustice,” said David,
eagerly, “surely we must welcome an opportunity to
correct it. He has worked against us, it is true. He
could overthrow our charter, but he chooses rather to
become one of our number. If I go abroad, I may fail
at the Court of Charles. If we can save our charter
here at home, it will be the grandest thing we have ever
done. And you can do it, my child—you can do this
great thing! You will, I feel you will!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was a little terrified. The old man’s anxiety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>was almost dreadful to see. Had he been laying bare
a steel crow-bar in his nature, she could not have comprehended
more thoroughly the stubbornness which she
felt opposition to him now would discover in her grandfather.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This comes to me so suddenly,” she said, “that I
cannot at once think upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you can think what it means to the colony!”
said the man, passionately. “You would wish to save
the charter! Mr. Randolph has become my friend. I
have found that my former estimate of his character
was false. He can take away our charter in a moment—his
work is done. But he also can save us! He
shall save us! Are you a daughter of this commonwealth—a
daughter of a patriot? You can save the
charter. Oh, what a glorious honor! You will let me
take your answer back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde’s color had gone again, not to return. This
was a moment that frightened her heart. No one could
have lived there as she had done and not be saturated
with the hopes and fears of the colonists, not be trembling
for the government, the independence, the manhood
they had builded up on those stern rocks. In
her first baby utterances she had lisped the word
“Charter.” For ten years their charter had been their
Holy Grail to those American men and women of Massachusetts.
The air was pregnant with patriotism.
The Charter had hung trembling in the balance month
after month, ever since Cromwell’s son had abdicated
the English throne and Charles had sat in power once
again. Garde could not have been the true daughter
of America she was, had she not thrilled first with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>possibilities of this fateful moment, before her soul shivered
at the price she would have to pay to perform this
splendid-seeming deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sense of duty had been bred and ingrained in the
children of that hour. It held a sway well-nigh incredible
in youthful minds. It fell athwart Garde’s
thought with appalling weight. And yet her soul
leaped to Adam’s arms for protection, as her heart
bounded to his with love. She felt as if she could
crash through the window and run away, to the woods,——anywhere,
to escape even the contemplation of this
thing. Had it not been for her knitting she felt she
must have done something dreadful. As it was she
seemed to tie herself into the pattern—the wilder self—and
so to gain a sense of calmness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could hardly answer this so soon,” she said.
“Haste first leaves no time for thought after.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thought, child?” demanded the old man, on whom
her calmness acted as her mother’s had before her.
“Can you wish to hesitate, when the whole state
stands breathless for your answer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did you hold me so lightly that you said, ‘Yes,’
the moment this was presented to you?” said Garde.
“Grandther, I was but a young girl this morning.
What has a moment done to make me such a woman as
this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But our charter—our government—our liberty,
child!” cried David, raising his two shaking hands
above his head. “You can save them all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And is it so light a matter for me to become the
mother of our liberty?” said Garde, on whom the spirit
of wisdom had strangely descended, no doubt from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Goody Dune. “Grandther, you would wish to think
of this yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had risen from her seat. She faced her grandfather
and he saw her eyes nearly on a level with his
own. A look of her mother, sad, appealing, forgiving,
played intangibly across her face. The old man’s look
seemed to follow its transit. He passed his nervous
fingers along his brow. The fire died away in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then think it over,” he said, huskily. “Think it
over, my child, think it over. I will not coerce your
decision. No, I’ll not coerce her, Ruth, no, no, I’ll
not!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He moved to the door, as one in a dream, and left the
room.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GARDE’S LONELY VIGIL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>David Donner</span> was not to be deterred for long, by
the shadow of a memory which he had seen flit like a
ghost of his past, across Garde’s features. He was arriving
at that age when a man’s memory is not so strong
as in years past and when the events of the day at hand
seem therefore the more important. He fretted under
his promise to go abroad, desiring this to be abrogated
by his fellow-colonists, and this could only be done
when he should persuade them that the charter would
be saved, or at least his country better served, by his
remaining where he was. He had not as yet spoken to
his colleagues of Randolph’s proposition. He was waiting
for Garde to give him her answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl watched the old man narrowly, to see how
long she could wait, for her answer was no more ready
after a week than it had been on the first day. This
was not entirely because her affections were placed elsewhere.
She was a little patriot, otherwise her love for
Adam would have prompted her reply at once, and
from hot lips. She was undergoing a genuine struggle
with herself. If it were true that she could save the
charter, should she permit her own happiness or Adam’s
to stand before the happiness and rights of all the
Massachusetts people? Had not Adam himself written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that when there are three and only two could be happy,
the one, representing the minority, should suffer sorrow,
that the greater number might preserve their joy?
Then, when she and Adam were only two, how much
more they should endure sorrow, when all the people of
that colony weighed against them in the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, it was not a simple matter in which her own desires
could speak out above the clamor of duty. And
yet, she could not feel the truth of Randolph’s position
and promise. Suppose he had not the ability, so to
save the charter as her grandfather believed he would.
Suppose, having the power, he should prove dishonest,
when once he had won his desire. What was there in
a wife to tie him to his obligation? If politics had
prompted him to go so far, would they not continue to
prompt him further, after the marriage had given him
his way? To sacrifice herself and Adam was to Garde
a mighty thing. She was capable of any heroism, but
her mind and her nature exacted that it be not specious.
No travail of motherhood ever gave a more acute or
prolonged agony than was Garde’s portion as she strove
to give birth to a wise and right resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her grandfather, in the meantime, waxed more and
more impatient. It had been his habit from early manhood
to have his own way. In avoiding precisely the
difficulties into which he had fallen with Garde’s mother,
he felt that he was on the safe side in his promise not
to coerce his grandchild. This gave him the greater
latitude in which to bring pressure upon her from what
he conceived to be another standpoint. Yet that repression
of his feelings and passions which he had
practised for long among the Puritans, made him more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>patient with Garde’s indecision than would otherwise
have been the case. He became childishly eager, more
than harshly insistent, in this frame of mind. He
coaxed her many times in a day, to see what her bravery
and loyalty could do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Christmas and New Year were long past, and still
Garde had made no decision. In the spring, when she
could make no more excuses for delaying, she told her
grandfather how gladly she would comply with his
wishes, if only she could know, absolutely, that Randolph
would keep faith with the colonists and secure
them their charter against all need for anxiety. This
was her honest word. It came from her heart as if
every word had been jagged, leaving her wounded and
all but ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let Mr. Randolph prove that he will work for our
good with the King,” she said. “Let him secure us
but one year of ease from this constant worry—let him
show us a year of the favor he can win from Charles,
and then I shall be content. This is not much that I
ask. If his heart is so set upon me as he says, surely
he could wait this time and do these things. A true
regard could wait for as many years as Jacob served for
Rachel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this decision, which he regarded as a binding
promise, and which he represented to Randolph as a
betrothal, David Donner had to be content. Randolph
could not, without betraying intended perfidy, object
to conditions so wisely conceived. Argument was precluded.
Grimly shutting his jaws, the man consented
to the arrangement, for else he must have abandoned
his quest altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>As the months wore on, he went regularly to South
Church, there to sit out the service, which he detested
like poison, for the purpose of fixing his eyes upon
Garde, as if he had been a beauty-vulture, only to be
satisfied by gazing upon her until he was all but self-hypnotized.
As for Garde, conscious as she was that
the man thus stared in her direction, she never so much
as once gave his eyes an answering glance. She did
not love him; there should never be any pretense,
come what might, that she did. Her thoughts and her
heart beats were true to Adam, and so should remain
to the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Donner told his colleagues in triumph of what
he had done, of the answer Garde had made and of the
hope they had for the future. He had justified himself
in remaining in Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>The measure of the power wielded, even at the throne
of England by Edward, Randolph could never have been
estimated in Massachusetts, but month after month
slipped away while the charter remained intact and the
men of that anxious colony breathed with a sense of
relief which none had felt before, in nearly a score of
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, with what hope her year’s respite inspired,
began her lonely wait and watch for Adam’s return.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A NIGHT ATTACK.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> night was a thing of perfection, on the sea.
The moon rode aloft and its light danced merrily on the
tips of the waves. A smart breeze pouted the sails on
the “Captain Spencer” till she plowed her way like a
skimming albatross through the phosphorescence of the
southern field of ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>On deck the beef-eaters, Adam and William Phipps,
with the mate and a jovial boatswain, were in high
spirits. They were nearing their goal, after a run
which would have awakened some sort of a rollicking
devil in a deacon. Captain Phipps had felt a spell of
bubbling coming upon him for days. It always did, the
moment he dropped Boston out of sight, over the green,
serrated edge of the riotous Atlantic. Therefore he
had broken off the neck of a bottle of good, red juice,
which had lain for a year in the hold of the brig, and
this liquified comfort had circulated generously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters, arm in arm, were now spraddling
about the deck in a dance of which Terpsichore had
never been guilty, even in her A B C’s of the art. The
boatswain was furnishing music from a tin pipe, the
one virtue of which was that it was tireless.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length he altered the tune, or at least, so he said,
and after a bar or two of the measure had lost itself in

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>There were more of these verses, one to fit every sea,
of which there be more than seven, as the song proved.
The beef-eaters and Captain Phipps joined in the
chorus, for the boatswain gave it a rare flavor of
music.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the wheel, the second mate had jammed a marlin
spike between the spokes, to hold the brig on the
wind, and sitting cosily down had gone fast asleep.
The lookout aloft had become absorbed in the singing,
to which he was bending every attention. In the midst
of a chorus, which might and might not have been the
finale of Adam’s ditty, there was a sudden alarm that
rang from one end to the other of the brig, and all too
abruptly a black hulk of a ship, with never a light,
came sizzling the brine in her speed, the length of a
few anchor-chains away, and made for the “Spencer”
with dire intent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The music ceased as if it had been cut off with a
knife. Scuttling swiftly to the side of the ship and
then bawling orders, and chasing to the armory in hot
haste, Phipps, Adam and the others yelled that a pirate
was upon them. The words, like an incantation of
marvelous potency, summoned men like so many
gnomes, from hatches, companion-ways and fo’castle,
on the instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brig’s deck suddenly swarmed with its own
men, running hither and thither, shouting, stumbling,
swearing, while Phipps and Rust came darting back
with arms full of cutlasses, pistols and muskets,
gathered helter-skelter, and now thrown with a great
clatter upon the planking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scrambling here to arm themselves, the sailors heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a crunch, felt the brig shudder beneath their feet and
beheld half a dozen iron hooks come flying over the
gunwale from the pirate, and saw them jerk snug up to
the rail, as the raiders pulled taut on the lines that
quickly lashed the two vessels together.</p>

<p class='c007'>A black cascade of men came leaping from the pirate,
landing heavily on the “Spencer’s” deck. Their pistols
blazed yellow exclamation points of fire, as the men
struck on their feet, and then with a clash of steel on
steel, Rust, Phipps and half a score of sailors rushed
upon the invaders and a mad scuffle and melée ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust was conscious of a few things about him in the
confusion. He thought how cold the naked blades
looked, slashing in the moonlight; he heard the yells
and curses against the background of a slapping sail
that was making a sound like a weird alarm; he felt
the strength of the big rascal, who was cutting at him
with that brute force and disregard for skill which is so
deadly to engage. He thought the fellow would slice
his saber in two. He lost no time in feinting. The
brute of a buccaneer lurched forward to sweep his
blade clean through Adam’s body and then suddenly a
moonbeam seemed to cleave its way through the
ruffian’s neck. He dropped his sword and spun around
with his head lolling sideways and went down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam rushed to the taff-rail. The pirate ship was
straining at the ropes by which her hooks secured the
two black hulks together. Smiting these taut ropes
with mad fury, Rust saw the pirate drift away and the
gulf of water widen between the two vessels, while the
scoundrels aboard the robber-ship yelled a discordant
chorus of curses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Then back into the fray, the din of which was rising,
as wounded men smarted and yelled and rushed upon
one another anew, like snarling wolves, Adam darted,
pistoling a creature who came running upon him and
then heaving him overboard as the fellow writhed on
the planks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sailors of the “Spencer” had somewhat the
best of the conflict, which was a match in scuffling
hotly all over the deck. Less than a dozen of the
pirates had been able to leap aboard before the vessels
were apart, and their bawlings for help to their ship
had been rendered vain, for the moment, by Adam’s
prompt action in cutting the lines. However, the sea-scoundrels
were versed in fighting, where the sailors
were merely rough-and-tumble sons of Cain whose rage
was their principal accoutrement. They were at their
adversaries, hammer and tongs. They were wrestling
with some, hacking at others, swearing at all. It was
a small pandemonium in which it was next to impossible
to distinguish friend from foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps, like the woodsman from Maine that he was,
hewed his way from one group to another, shouting to
his men, hoarsely. The beef-eaters, as inseparable as
when they were dancing, chose but one man between
them, and one such they peeled to a horrid core, as
the demon rushed upon their sharpened weapons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam stepped in a crawling line of gore, its head
silver-tipped in the moonlight, and slipped till it
wrenched him to hold his footing. He saw the sailors
crowding three of the pirates to the rail and, joining
them, battered the cutlasses from their fists and helped
to hoist them bodily over and into the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The din had hardly abated anything of its volume.
The scene was one of the maddest activity. But the
robbers not already done for, were now at bay against
the masts, the capstan or the rail. One tripped backward
over a coil of rope. The next instant he was
screaming help and murder at the top of his lungs.
This he continued even after a dreadful rattle and
spluttering came in his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over the reddened decks one or two wounded creatures
were crawling, one wiping gore from his face
and flinging it off his fingers. Swords and pistols lay
about. One dying human was lying on his side,
with his arm extended and his index finger slowly
crooked and straightened and crooked again, as if he
beckoned to death to come more quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sail began to slap at the mast again, as the brig
swung bow on in the wind and stopped in stays. The
croaked curses of the pirates, on their ship, which was
now again drawing swiftly toward the “Spencer,” made
Adam and Phipps suddenly run to the brig’s brass gun,
which was looking dumbly forth toward the pirate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust had filled his pocket with loose powder. The
cannon was already loaded. He poured a small pyramid
of powder on the vent and he and Phipps, with
the combined strength of two giants, slewed the piece
around till a ball from the pirate could have been tossed
into its yawning muzzle.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the galley, the cook came running with blazing
coals on a shovel. He had been watching the gun.
The pirate missed her mark. She came up in stays, just
as the “Spencer” got again on the wind. The bows
of the robber-craft were almost in touch with the brig.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Adam saw that the cannon would fail to sweep the
pirate’s decks—that the shot would be practically
wasted, if it went at the gun’s present elevation. With a
sudden impulse he leaped astride its smooth, brass nose
and bore it down, depressing the muzzle toward the
water, just as the crazy cook turned his shovel upside
down on the primed vent.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was suddenly a deafening roar. The concussion
shook every man’s feet from under him. The gun
leaped backward, like a bucking horse, and Rust went
sprawling on the decks, for he had been left abruptly,
with no support beneath him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shot tore a hole in the pirate the size of a hogshead,
squarely on her water-line, in her starboard bow.
She came about in the wind and the sea rushed into
her hold in a torrent.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dreadful silence ensued when the air was clear of
the detonation. Then a moan from a dying wretch on
the “Spencer’s” deck seemed to touch into being a
chorus of yells from the doomed pirate, where the
murderous crew found themselves armed to the teeth
and yet sinking, defenseless, into the very jaws of
death. Their sails slackened again and shook with a
sound as of funeral shrouds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Spencer” scudded away into the boulevard of
silver which the moon was paving with its light. The
sinking pirate gathered the cannon’s smoke about her
and settled swiftly, but not in silence, into the grave
that fitted so snugly about its body.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE GLINT OF TREASURE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> brig “Captain Spencer,” came duly to her goal at
the green Bahamas. What with wounds received from
the pirates, who had called so unceremoniously, and
from sea-sickness, which they always had, the beef-eaters
were glad of the sight of land. Phipps and Rust
were filled with rejoicings by reason of the dreams they
had of thrusting a naked arm apiece into the sea and
fetching up handfuls of gold with which to return to
two sweet women in Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>All hands were presently doomed to disappointment.
Phipps learned that his treasure-ship was indeed a fact,
but that she was small, both in tonnage and her burden
of Spanish coins, that she lay in many fathoms of
water and that, indeed, she was scarcely worth serious
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps was, however, a popular man at these bits of
jeweled land in the emerald sea. He had traded there
on several occasions, making friends always. Thus it
came that a hobbling old salt, whom he had befriended
in a scrimmage, consoled him with the information of
a large treasure-ship, sunk somewhere in the neighborhood
of Hispaniola. He resolved at once to pursue
this matter to the end, for which purpose the “Captain
Spencer” would be wholly inadequate, as the Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Main was as filled with pirates as the sky may be of
buzzards over dying caravans.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the approval of the entire party, the brig was
now headed for England, Adam and Phipps feeling
confident of their ability to secure a larger ship for
their enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>On familiar soil when the “Spencer” at length
came to anchor, off the tower of London, in the
Thames, Adam had little difficulty in finding a market
for the brig. With the proceeds of the sale in his
pockets, William Phipps, under Adam’s tuition, blossomed
out as a gentleman of no little personal attractiveness.
Adam, as one born to the purple, donned a
handsome attire and swaggered with all the elegance
of a prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was soon in the midst of his former acquaintances,
with one of whom he fought a duel at the end of the
first week, requiring his vanquished foe, who was only
sufficiently wounded to be satisfied, to kneel in humility
and to wipe the victor’s blade clean of his own red
juice, on the hem of his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust until now had never had occasion to regret the
disfavor in which Charles Stuart held him, since a certain
distinguished lady had declared the “Sachem” to be
vastly more entertaining than his Majesty with ready
narratives. However, he was undismayed, for with
James, fated so soon to be king, he was amazingly
friendly.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps, for his part, needed but one introduction
and no recommendation. Above all things
temporal, James reveled in naval adventure. Blunt,
gallant Captain Phipps appealed to him instantly. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>tale of the treasure-ship set him aflame with eagerness
to go with this adventurous company to the western
Indies, where he could readily picture himself, Phipps
and Adam fighting their way to the rotting strongholds
of the Spanish galleon, sunk there half a century before.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an alacrity which was of a highly complimentary
character to Phipps and Rust, the Prince procured a
fine vessel, the “Rose-Algier,” with a crew of ninety-five
men and an armament of eighteen guns, and gave
her into the trust of his friends for their enterprise.
It was agreed that inasmuch as he thus found the ship
and the expenses of the venture, he should have ninety
per cent. of whatsoever treasure should be recovered,
Phipps declaring for himself and Adam how contented
they would be with the remaining one-tenth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in the year, which was 1684, the “Rose-Algier”
bore away for Hispaniola, Phipps, Adam, and
the faithful beef-eaters, whom seasickness nor peril
could drive from Adam’s side, soon beginning to wonder
what manner of crew it was with which they had
shipped. A few weeks later, King Charles the Second
died. James ascended the throne. Thus the treasure-seekers
were backed by the English monarch and his
government.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sunken ship has frequently proved to be a small
thing, and the ocean a large one, to the seeker, eager for
its cargo. The “Rose-Algier” dipped into all manner
of harbors and her master asked all manner of people
all manner of questions, to no avail. The months
slipped by, in this tedious occupation, the crew grew
weary of a voyage so profitless and so entirely unpromising.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The grumblings of mutiny have a way of keeping below
decks, where they simmer volcanically. Nevertheless
the beef-eaters heard something of the discontent
in the fo’castle, where the ruffians of the crew were for
seizing the vessel, running up the black flag and turning
pirate forthwith. The Rose was a swift, great bird
upon the waves, she was armed to the teeth, she was
well provisioned. What more could be desired for buccaneering?
And piracy paid its disciples handsomely.
Spain and France, particularly, had a hundred argosies
in constant flight between the West Indies and
home. Gold was the commonest burden of all. Your
pirate was a dare-devil, whose life was reputed to be one
long round of adventure, drinking and looting. All
pirates either died happy or hung, and anything was
better than this pothering about in a good ship, seeking
for treasure that was sunk admittedly, while millions of
treasure was afloat and nearly all to be had for the asking.
With precious few exceptions the crew agreed
that this was true enough for every practical purpose.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>MUTINY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Fortunately</span> mutinies frequently come to a head
prematurely. On the “Rose” a jealousy hatched between
rival factions of the plotters, so that before they
were any of them in actual readiness, one faction, in
order to be ahead of and therefore in command over
the other, rushed upon the quarter-deck one night
and made a sudden descent on Captain Phipps, who
happened for the moment to be there alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps became renowned for his presence of mind
and courage. On this occasion he promptly knocked
down three or four of the ruffians, and then with a
loaded revolver and a handy marlin spike, he awed the
others into submission before the alarm had even time
to spread. The malefactors being summarily placed in
irons and thrown into the hold, the insurrection below
decks retired into the dark corners, to knit itself anew
into shape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sailors now recognized the necessity for uniting
their forces. Moreover, the faction which had been
less precipitate, gained the confidence of those half-coward,
half-demon followers, or human jackals, who
were willing to urge the lions of the fo’castle on to
strike the blows of death, content if they could then
sneak upon the scene for a feast of remains. Thus a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>better plan was laid, while the mutineers dissembled
and lulled even the suspicious Phipps into a sense of security
that he had not possessed before the overt outbreak,
which he had been able to quell single-handed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plotters found no opportunity of effecting their
designs for several weeks. At length, however, Phipps
steered his vessel into a tiny harbor, bitten by the sea
into the side of a small, uninhabited island, which was
even minus a name. This he did for the purpose of
reshipping the stores, in the hold, a recent storm having
shifted this cargo until the “Rose” listed to port
dangerously, and leaked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crew, in silence and obediently enough, constructed
a bridge to shore and carried the stores to
land, heaping them up in piles, on the beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unlading being accomplished, the crew desired
permission to rest in the shade of the near-by woods.
This was granted. Once in retirement here, they conceived
a plan without delay whereby the ship should
fall into their hands that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already they had managed to purloin a complement
of arms. They had knives, a few pistols, hatchets and
several cutlasses. The stores being ashore, the ship
was at their mercy. Their plan was simple enough.
They would remain away from the shore until seven
o’clock, when they would proceed to the ship in a
body, overpower Phipps, Rust, the beef-eaters and the
few other faithful souls on board, seize the “Rose”
and leave her captain and his friends on the island, to
starve. There was but one element lacking—the
ship’s carpenter. The “Rose” having sprung a leak,
in the storm, was regarded by the sailors as no longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>seaworthy, until the carpenter should put her right.
He therefore became a necessary adjunct to their
numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The carpenter, on being summoned to appear among
them by the crew, listened to their plan with horror.
However, he was not a coward and he had his wits
about him. He nodded as if in approval of the plan,
the more readily, perhaps, as he was threatened with
death if he dared refuse to become one of the murderous
gang. Then he informed them that some of his
tools he would much require, to further the plot.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was sent aboard the ship, with a guard beside
him, who had undertaken to see that he permitted no
leakage of the crew’s little game into the ears of the
Captain. However, this carpenter was a man of resources.
He was suddenly overpowered by illness, on
which pretense he went below. Then, breaking into a
run, he came to the Captain’s cabin, where Adam was
singing the song of his loves. Bidding Rust to continue,
as if nothing was happening, he swiftly communicated
his news to William Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go back at once and pretend to assist in their deviltry,”
commanded Phipps. “Make no sign of anything,
save compliance with their wishes, and leave the
rest to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The carpenter rejoined his guard so soon that they
were entirely satisfied. They conveyed him ashore, with
his tools, and joining their mates again, waited with
what patience they could muster, for the fateful hour
of seven to arrive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps had now two hours in which to prepare to
defend the ship. Unfortunately some of the guns had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>been landed with the stores. Adam volunteered to
draw the loads from these, and this he accomplished,
with highly satisfactory speed. But it would have
been the work of hours to re-transfer the stores to the
hold, hence they were left on shore to themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>With close on ninety armed, desperate brutes against
them, the handful of men on the “Rose” were hardly
in an enviable position. The first thing they did was
to remove the bridge which had been constructed between
the ship and the shore. The remaining guns on
board were then dragged and slewed around till they
covered the approach from the woods, by which the
mutineers would be obliged to come. There was
nothing to be done, then, but to wait.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crew were not disappointing. They appeared
duly, their savagery whetted to a fine edge by the
burly ruffian who had assumed command of their force.
Phipps had prepared his speech. He hailed the men,
in his big, gruff voice and commanded them to halt
where they were, on pain of instant annihilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go near the stores,” he cried, “and I will blow
you in splatters against those trees!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cowed scoundrels edged back toward the woods.
All the muttered threats of their leader, of what he
would do if they refused to charge, were empty to the
wretches who could look into the chasm-like mouths
of a dozen guns. There courage oozed out of their
veins. They were already defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps, aware that a similar number of dummies
would be equally dangerous, now, had his faithful followers
run out the bridge again and bring aboard the
stores, without which it would have been madness to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>sail. This work consumed no small amount of time.
But it was finally concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now then,” said Phipps, when the situation was
all in his favor, “I shall pull up anchor and leave you
rogues to the fate you had prepared for me. You can
stay here and starve and rot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This brought the mutineers to tears, and to pleading
on their knees. They were willing to come to any
nameable terms, if only he would spare them this terrible
fate. They threw down their arms, in token of
absolute surrender, begging quarter of any description.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch as so large a vessel could not have been
sailed without a crew, Phipps received them back, the
ring-leaders in chains, and doubled the vigor of his
mastery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Adam,” he said, “it’s no use with these
scoundrels. They will drive me back to England yet,
with none of the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Distrustful of the brutes he had between decks,
Phipps now sailed for Jamaica, where he quickly discharged
nearly every man Jack of his mutinous crew
and took on a new lot of sailors. This was not a matter
of a few days, it required nearly a fortnight of time,
Phipps being exceedingly particular as to the men he
selected. In the meantime two things occurred which
gave no little anxiety to the treasure-seeking captain.
Rust fell ill, with an attack of tropical fever, and a
letter arrived from Goodwife Phipps in which she
begged to know if her lord and master were still alive,
and if so, would he not speedily return to Boston and
give no further heed to fortune’s beckoning.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps had seen men sicken and die in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>latitudes. Adam, attended faithfully by the beef-eaters,
took the fever lightly, as he seemed to take
everything of life. Nevertheless he was weak, when
the heat had somewhat abated in his body, and in no
fit condition to remain in the tropics.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” said the Captain, gravely, having schooled
himself for a day and night together for this moment,
“I have about concluded that the ‘Rose’ is no longer
fit for this service. I shall return to Hispaniola, but
unless I shall make out the galleon in a few weeks, I
shall sail again to England, for a newer ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Adam. “I shall be ready this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Phipps, hemming and hawing, “the
fact is, Adam, you are quite unfit to remain about these
islands. Besides, I should be glad of a messenger to
send back to Mrs. Phipps in Boston. I would suggest,
therefore, that you return thither, on a frigate, sailing
to-morrow morning, and if it chance that I go to England
and again return to Hispaniola, you could meet
me here and help me to find the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust seemed to hesitate before making his reply.
He was sure there was a treasure for him in Boston,
but he had begun to have his doubts as to the sunken,
or any other sort of available, gold in the Spanish Main.
Yet he did not wish to appear eager to abandon the
quest, and his heart was above all else loyal to Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I should, by great good fortune, discover the
treasure,” continued the Captain, “you shall suffer no
loss for your absence, for your services have been ten
times over rendered already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Much as he was affected by the friendship which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>prompted Phipps to assure him of this, Adam was not
in the least concerned with thoughts of the treasure,
nor influenced by this generous plan which his friend
had formulated. But being a reasonable being, in some
directions, and being perhaps unreasonably inclined in
others, as for instance, toward Massachusetts, he saw
the wisdom of the Captain’s arrangements, and therefore
bade his friend an affectionate farewell, on the
following day, and sailed for the north, with the beef-eaters
close at his heels.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GARDE’S EXTREMITY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Had</span> prayers been able to reach him and summon
him back to Boston, Adam would have been there long
before the fever overtook him at Jamaica. Garde,
more alone than she had ever been in her life, had appealed
to the stars, to the wind, to the tides of the sea,
to convey her yearnings to Adam and to bid him hasten
to her side. She was alone because she, only, distrusted
Randolph. She was alone because she felt no longer
the slightest companionship with her grandfather, because
even Wainsworth and Tootbaker respected the
provisional betrothal she had made with Randolph and
because not to Prudence nor even to Goody Dune had
she felt she could confide her cares and the breaking of
her heart, under the present painful circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her distrust of Randolph had grown, despite the fact
that, in a measure, the threats against the charter had
ceased and a pseudo peace contented the patriots with
the thought that their difficulties had been finally remedied
by the alliance to which they all now looked
forward with abnormal interest and confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had maintained her right of immunity from
the attentions of Randolph, consistently and steadfastly.
She had never given him the single glance, at
Meeting, or elsewhere, for which he was becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>crazed. The light of malice that burned in his eyes
was a thing that Garde felt, occultly. It was a threat
to break her will, some day; it was tigerish in its animal
hunger. No creature of prey ever lay in wait for its
victim more ready to pounce, to overpower and to drag
away to its den the coveted object of its greed and
passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the months had winged heavily away on their
somber-colored pinions, and the moment for which
Garde had hoped, when she set the one year’s time of
probation had never come—the moment of Adam’s return.
The second Christmas, so joyless with the Puritans,
was far off, with the other departed days of
winter. The snow had melted; the tender shoots of
grass were returning, in hordes, like little green armies;
the first buds were breaking the cold, dank soil and
peeking forth, while still close wrapped, as if to say:
“Is it time?” And only Garde would have pushed
them back, only Garde, usually so joyous in the returning
of warmth and beauty, would have held to the edge
of the mantle of snow, to retain it where it lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart was beating like a lead clapper, that tolled
against the bell of her soul, day and night, for the fear
that was on her of the coming week, when her
year of respite would end. Already her grandfather
looked at her with fanatical eagerness in his eyes, and
rubbed his shaking hands with delight. He had no
eyes to see that she was pale, that she started at sounds
as she had never done before, fearing that Randolph
had come a few days too soon, to claim and to carry
her off. The old man’s one idea was the safety of the
charter. To secure this, no sacrifice could have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>too great. But as a matter of fact, David Donner had
no conception of the sacrifice which he was requiring.
Such zealots rarely have.</p>

<p class='c007'>In despair, three days before her dreaded hour should
arrive, Garde hastened like a child, afraid of an ogre,
to Goody Dune. The evening was cold, for the sky
was overcast, the wind was blowing from the north and
a few scattered speckles of snow flew spitefully through
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“B-u-h-h—it’s cold! B-u-h-h—it’s cold!” said the
jackdaw, when Garde came in at the door. The bird
was echoing the past winter’s history of what poor old
Goody had suffered, alone in her hut.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, dearie,” said the old woman, who was evidently
making preparations to go out, on some mission
of her own, “you look as if you too are in need of some
of the simples you gathered in the summer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is nothing simple that I need,” said Garde. “I
have come for wisdom and help. Oh, Goody, I don’t
know what I shall do. I wish so I had come to you
sooner!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must stop trembling first,” said Goody.
“Here, take this cup of tea. It is going to be a bitter
night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had prepared the drink for herself, to fortify
her meager warmth of body against the wind, into
which she expected to go on an errand, presently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not from the cold; it is inside that I am
trembling,” confessed the girl. But she took the cup,
obediently. “If you can do nothing to help me, I could
wish the cold would never let me go back to my home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there, drink the tea,” said Goody, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>giving her one penetrative glance. For young women
to feel that terrible demi-mania of desiring self-destruction
was not new to Goody Dune. She had gone through
the stages herself. She knew almost exactly the conditions
which universally promote the emotion in the
young of her sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that Adam has never returned,” she said,
slowly. “You have had no word, even. I have seen
that in your eyes. But, dear me, have you no abiding
faith and hope, child? In the spring——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh it isn’t that, Goody!” broke in Garde. “I
could wait—I could wait for him fifty years, patiently—yes,
patiently. I love him. But you don’t know
what has happened. I have never told you. What
was the use! They made me promise;—and if Adam
knew—he might never come back. No—he would not
come back. And I love even the very places where his
shadow fell, in the forest—and the log he was sitting
on. I love the gate where his hands rested—I love
everything he ever touched!” Her hands pressed upon
her bosom, where, beneath her frock, she wore the
brooch from Hispaniola.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody had never seen her in such a mood. She had
never heard such passion from her lips. But by the
memory of her own heart-break, she caught at the
sinister cry of something promised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And have you given yourself in promise to somebody
else?” she asked, quietly, but somewhat severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grandther forced me. What could I do?” said
Garde, feverishly. “What could anybody do, with the
charter being taken away? If I could save it, I ought
to save it! But he will never, never keep his word!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>He is deceiving them all,—I feel it! I know it! He
is a wicked man! But you will tell me what to do.
You must tell me what to do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down, dearie,” said the old woman, calmly.
“You must tell me all about it. I cannot prescribe,
even simples, until you let me know what you are driving
at, you know. Now who is this he, through whom
you are to save the charter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know how it ever happened,” said Garde.
“He was always known to be the enemy of the colony,
but he did something to Grandther, who has never
been the same man since Mr. Randolph——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Edward Randolph!” interrupted Goody, with a
sudden vehemence, the like of which she had never before
betrayed to Garde. “Did you say Edward Randolph?
Have you promised to marry him, to save the
charter? There, there, sit down and tell me your
story, quietly. Only, do make haste.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde wondered, momentarily, at the old woman’s
abrupt outburst. It served to give her a new hold on
herself, for it broke her own morbid thought and excitement.
She told Goody what had happened to mar
her happiness almost before Adam’s kiss had ceased to
burn on her fingers. She told it brokenly, incoherently,
for she knew all the details of the story so vividly that
she could not realize that Goody was not also in possession
of the entire fabric of thoughts and struggles
which had brought about her grandfather’s cherished
end. However, Goody Dune was a woman, and quick-minded
and astute at that. She patched as rapidly as
Garde gave her the irregular fragments of the tale.
She had shut her mouth tightly at the end of her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>outburst, and it seemed to Garde her lips had grown
harder since. Her eyes were certainly snapping crisply.
Goody was aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with me,” she presently said, interrupting
Garde’s outpourings again. “When you came I was
starting to go where it would be well for you to follow,
before the hour grows later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Goody, won’t you tell me what to do?” said
Garde, in anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will know what to do, when you go home,”
said the old woman, somewhat grimly. “I know
Edward Randolph by his works.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She led the way out into the gathering twilight without
further delay. Garde shivered a little, as the cold
wind struck her again, but she followed, eagerly, with
wonder in her heart and a little awe of Goody, in her
tortured mind. What could the old woman mean?
Where could she now be hastening?</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody proceeded with a straightness that argued
familiarity with the route, and fixity of purpose in her
mind. She went by alleys that led down toward the
water, where fisher-folk had builded little shanties on
the rocks above the roar of the harbor breakers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am taking you to see another young woman,” she
said. “She was pretty too, and she had no parents.
Her mother died five years ago, and her father, James
Hodder, was lost in the storm, last spring. She was
an easy prey, you see. Poor Hester! and only fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde looked at the old woman in wonder. All this
half muttered preface to something coming, served to
make her heart beat so hard that she could hear it,
painfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“What is it about her?” she asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody made no answer. She had reached the door
of one of the huts, and pushing it open she entered,
Garde, pale and large-eyed, close behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ned—oh Ned!” came a half sob, half chortle of
joy from somewhere in the darkness of the place.
Garde felt shivers go down her entire form.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not Ned yet, my love,” said Goody, in a voice so
cooing that Garde hardly knew it. “Presently, dear,
presently. He is sure to come back to-night. Dear
me, we must have a light and see how we’re doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had heard a little moan which Goody’s cooing
had not sufficed to smother. Then there had been
the sound of a stifled sob. Goody went to the dying
embers in the chimney-place, to get a light for a tallow
dip on which she had put her hand with unerring
familiarity with the furnishings of the place. The
voice, with tears and patience in its syllables, came again:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will come—back, to-night? He—didn’t come—last
night. He hasn’t—come for a—week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes, he will surely come to-night,” crooned
Goody, at the fireplace. “But how is the little
dollie?” Garde was leaning back against the door,
heavily. Her eyes were staring into the utter darkness
with which the place was filled. She felt the presence
of a woman on a bed of motherhood. She was
ready to sink on the floor, with terrible apprehensions.
The woman on the bed made some heroic effort to calm
herself, and to answer Goody’s question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s sleeping,” she said. “She was so cold, but
I have got her warm again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tallow dip now flared. Goody shielded it cautiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>as it sputtered and then she arose to her feet.
Between her fingers the light spread, throwing great,
grotesque shadows of her hand on the walls, in one
direction and a larger adumbration of her head in the
other. Garde saw the couch, which she had known
was in the corner. She also saw a white face, too thin
to be pretty, and all of a soul’s being and anguish concentrated
in two great eyes. Her own eyes were blazing
with the emotions by which she was possessed. As
if there had been some great affinity between them, the
young woman on the couch was looking at Garde the
moment the dip illumined the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s that?” said the startled Hester on the couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A friend, a friend, dear,” said Goody. “I brought
her to see you. She knows Edward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She—she knows Ned?” said the wasted young
mother, raising herself up, abruptly. “Let me see her.
Oh, oh,—you are so pretty! But you won’t take him
away from me—you won’t take him, please? He does
really love me—he didn’t mean what he said. He must
love me, now. He hasn’t seen our little baby, or he
would love me more than anything in the world. You
wouldn’t take him away from me—now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Hester sat there, propped up by one thin, white
arm, brushing her hair from her face and leaning
eagerly toward her visitor, Garde could only put her
hand to her cheek and shake her head. Her bosom
rose and fell in the agitation which was shaking her
whole being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am so glad—oh, I knew you wouldn’t,” said
the girl on the couch. “You couldn’t have the heart,
could you? See—see!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Weakened as she was, she made a great effort to rally
her strength and dragged a little bundle forth from between
the blankets and her own throbbing bosom, where
she had kept it partially warm. She was stifling sobs
all the time she was speaking. Her nerveless fingers
sought in the folds with instinctive tenderness, to uncover
a tiny face, as immobile as marble. “It’s our
little child,” said the mother. “She looks so like him.
He would have to love me now—you see he couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody took the babe in her arms. Garde saw everything.
She saw the tidy poverty of the hut. She saw
the ghost of the girlish beauty, which this abandoned
mother had once possessed. She saw the young creature
tuck in, next her bosom, ecstatically, a worn-out
stocking—a man’s stocking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde wanted to flee, but Goody brought her the babe—a
little doll indeed. Goody took her hand, for Garde
seemed stricken with helplessness, and placed it lightly
on the tiny, white face of the child. The girl drew it
away with a shudder. The babe was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go home, dearie,” said Goody, in a croon. “You
will know what to do. God makes few of the marriages
laid at His door, but He does make some of these.
Hester has a right to believe He made her a wife—else
why a mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde opened the door and ran out, glad, oh so glad
it was cold!</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>RANDOLPH’S COURTSHIP.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Garde</span> fled home as if some unthinkable fate were in
pursuit. She was haunted by the look she had seen in
the eyes of that girl-mother, back in the hut. She
could hear the young thing still begging her not to rob
her of the man who had taken her all and given her an
ineradicable shame in exchange.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet beneath every other emotion, Garde felt a sense
of exultation. The estimate of her instinct was confirmed—Randolph
was perfidy itself. Not a soul among
the Puritans, she believed, could do aught but support
her against this man. And if only she could wrench
herself free, how gladly would she welcome the penance
of waiting years for Adam, in payment for her act,
which she felt was disloyalty, in consenting to the provisional
betrothal into which she had been forced!</p>

<p class='c007'>Her grandfather now would have to be the first to
protect her from the dread fate which had come so near,
she thought. To confuse politics and the personal affairs
of her narrow life is the privilege of the sex to which
Garde belonged. She planned, as she darted through
the wind-swept streets. She would tell it all to
Grandfather Donner, and then he should save her the ordeal
of meeting Edward Randolph in any manner whatsoever.
She gave no thought to the charter, nor to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>what the man with the power he wielded would do in
revenge to their liberties, now that he would find himself
baffled, at the end of his term of waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>She yearned for Adam. She could tell him, now,
what she had been driven to do, whereas before this
she had always wished him to come, yet had shrunk
from the thought of confessing what she had permitted
to be done. Yes, she could lay it all bare before him
now, and fairly scourge herself with her own reproaches,
joyously. What an exquisite pleasure it would be to
ask his forgiveness thus, and not at first receive it, and
then at last be taken home to his arms and his love!
For her thoughts, her heart-beats, her soul’s longings
had all been constant to him, and to him alone. She
would like to tell him all this. And she would let him
kiss her, now. For through what hours had she wished,
when she had thought they might never meet in that
way again, that his kiss had been placed upon her lips
that day of their parting. She almost frightened herself
with the thought of how that one kiss on her fingers
might have been his only kiss. But the next moment
she tingled with ecstasy, to think she was free and that
some day he would come back, and then she would
know how to love him and to cherish him as never
before she could have known.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus glowing one moment, with love’s own reveries,
and chilling the next, with sudden reminders of what
had just been and what might still be, she reached her
grandfather’s house, where she had been staying with
the old man for the past year, with only rare visits to
the Soams. She went in by the kitchen door. This
apartment being dark, she passed through to the dining-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>which was lighted but unoccupied, hence she continued
on to the parlor, where she fancied she heard
voices. Entering here, she could have fallen to the
floor in sheer astonishment and fright.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found herself confronting her grandfather and
Edward Randolph himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, here she is, you see,” said David Donner, rubbing
his hands together, delightedly. “I thought she
couldn’t be far away. My child, Mr. Randolph has
come to have a little chat. Natural enough, I should
think.” He chuckled with pleasure, adding: “Dear
me, I mustn’t forget to cover my rose, on a night like
this.” With fatuous smiles, that ill suited his grim old
visage, he quitted the room, in a sprightly, playful
manner, and left Garde facing Randolph, alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening, Mistress Merrill,” said the man,
fastening the hungry gaze of his deep-set eyes upon her
face. “I am glad to see you looking so well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening, sir, and thank you,” said Garde, in
a voice scarcely audible. She had become suddenly
pale. She trembled. She looked at the man as one
fascinated by a baleful point of light.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seemed but reasonable that I should call and see
you, since our betrothal is so soon to end in our marriage,”
said Randolph, moving slowly toward her, as if
to prolong his own anticipation of standing where he
could reach her at last. “I have been very patient,
have I not, my pretty sweetheart?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—have been very—patient,” echoed Garde,
helplessly and panting like a spent doe, to catch her
breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I have kept my word,” he went on, still slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>approaching. “Massachusetts has her charter, and
now—I have my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He put out his hand, like a talon, to clutch her fast.</p>

<p class='c007'>One convulsive shiver seemed to break the spell which
had held Garde enthralled. She leaped away, her eyes
blazing, her lips quivering, her frame shaken with
emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” she cried. “No! Don’t touch me! Keep
away! I loathe you! I know what you are! Keep
away,—I can’t bear you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this?” said the man, scowling, till his
great brow threw a sinister shadow as far down as his
cheek bones. “Have a care, my dear Garde. We
made our bargain a year ago. This is no time
for kittenish pranks. Come back here where you
were.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His tone was authoritative. The gleam in his eyes
was a warning against disobedience. But Garde could
be no further frightened than he had made her by his
mere presence. She stood there, alert for the first
sign which would send her running, if need be, to jump
through the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall never touch you, nor go near you!” she
said. “There is no bargain between us. I would
rather die than to be your wife! I know what you are,
I say. I have been to Hester Hodder’s, to-night! I
have seen her. I know what you are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph took hold of his lip and pinched it viciously.
He glared at the girl in silence, for a moment.
“This has nothing to do with me,” he said. “You
have made some mistake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I made a terrible mistake when I first submitted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>this loathsome plan,” said Garde, gaining courage as
she spoke. “I always distrusted you, despised you.
Do you think I would trust a man to save our charter
who wouldn’t save a woman’s honor—who would do
what you have done? You may go—you may go away!
I loathe you! I scorn you! Oh, I have found you out
in time!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is silly talk, Mistress Merrill,” said the man.
“I know nothing of your Hester Hodder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde made a gesture expressive of disgust and impatience.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But all this has no bearing on anything one way or
the other,” Randolph continued. “You must not forget
that I have as much power over the charter and the
colony as ever—in fact, more. I have become the
friend of these people, but you can make me their
enemy with a very little of your nonsense. Come, now,
let us be two sensible beings and not begin our union
by quar——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you have had any power to do us injury,” interrupted
Garde, “we will find it done. You wouldn’t
dare to trust yourself. I have a fear, such as I never
had before, of the harm you have doubtless done this
colony, darkly, in the year just passed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had a way, fairly uncanny, of saying terrible
truths, as if from some sort of inspiration, which came
upon her unawares. Randolph had his pockets full of
documents, at that moment, which lay there like a mine
of explosives, ready to shatter the charter and government,
almost at his whisper of command. His mind
could conceive of nothing so exquisite in treachery, to
these people that he hated, and in vengeance against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Garde, for the attitude she had always assumed toward
him, as to marry her first and then to destroy the charter
afterward. This had been his dream for more than the
year. He had waited for its climax as patiently as a
cat will wait before a hole till the mouse shall reappear.
Garde’s words were as so many poignards, only that
they failed to strike him in a fatal spot. They stung
him to greater fury than he had ever felt and to a hotter
determination to humble the girl and to reduce
Massachusetts to abject servility and despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man saw that this was an ill time to threaten
Garde. She was not made of the wax which his sophistries
had substituted for the metal once in David Donner’s
composition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have entertained some strange ideas of me,
Mistress Merrill, for which I am at a loss to account,”
he said, more quietly. “I feel sure we merely misunderstand
each other. Have I not shown, for a
year, that my one wish is to prove myself a staunch
friend of these good people and worthy of your esteem?
I am willing to do anything further, if you can think
of anything you would like to suggest, before we are
married.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall never be married,” said the girl, self-possessed,
now, and calm enough to be fairly judicial. “If
you wish to win my respect, go and marry Hester Hodder,
and let your child not be buried in shame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man winced, but not visibly. He took his lip in
his fingers again and pinched it till it was white. He
realized that in her present frame of mind, Garde was
utterly incorrigible. He only made matters worse by
remaining where she was. He knew of a trick worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>two of prolonging this interview. Yet he must retire
in good order.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must tell you once more,” he said, “that I know
nothing about this person of whom you speak. I regret
that something has prejudiced your mind against
me, especially when you insist upon doing me this
wrong. Let me say good night, for I am sure I shall
find you in an altered mood to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good night,” said Garde, icily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man smiled and went out, closing the door as if
it had been the bars of a cage, which he had dared to
enter, at the risk of frightening his prey to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went out into the garden and called to David
Donner.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>DAVID’S COERCION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>David Donner</span> came in from that interview in the
garden an angered fanatic. The bitter cold of the
night had entered into his soul, with all the heaped-up
threats which Randolph had hurled at his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>These threats had not been fired at David loudly nor
fiercely. Randolph had told him of Garde’s insubordination,
of her charges and of her repudiation of her
promise. He had shown that whether her allegations as
to Hester Hodder were true or false, they had nothing
to do with Massachusetts politics. He had then opened
up with his main battery—a recital of the power he had
steadily accumulated, during the past year, and of
his intention to use it, immediately, if Donner and
Garde now failed in the slightest particular to keep
their share of the bargain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Donner became nearly crazed. For a year he had
dwelt with fondness upon the topic of the charter and
of how he had saved it, until nothing else could get
foothold in his mind. Indeed he had become mildly
insane upon the subject. He had counted the days,
and finally the hours waiting for the final ratification
of the contract with Randolph, whose influence with
King James had exceeded even that which he had exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>when Charles sat upon the throne. To reflect
that now, at the eleventh hour, the mere whim of a silly
girl could destroy this whole fabric and sweep away
their jealously guarded liberty and independence, at a
single breath, nearly made a maniac of the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hester Hodder was as nothing. A hundred such
women, with their dead babes, would have been as
nothing, compared to the safety of the charter. What
had Garde been born for, if she was not to save the
day, when her promise was made and when she alone
stood between ruin and the colony? What was her
girlish folly, that it should stand in the path forbidding
the colony its existence? What should be her
very life, when the matter against it weighed so
ponderously?</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking what his compatriots would say, if they
should learn of this latest turn of affairs, Donner wrung
his hands in agony, and then clenched them in rage.
For twenty years the charter had fluttered between life
and death. For the last year it had gained in strength
till it seemed that all danger had passed. No religious
fanaticism, no zeal of inquisitions ever possessed a
man’s soul, heart and brain more thoroughly than his
patriotism possessed Grandfather Donner.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he went into the house, his trembling, bony
hands were as cold as those of a skeleton. He was half
crying, with his utter vexation and fear for the charter,
and yet he ground his teeth, in his anger and stubborn
determination to compel his grandchild to adhere
to her promise. When he came to where Garde
was awaiting his return indoors, she mistook the mad
light in his eyes for righteous indignation at Randolph’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>perfidy, of which she believed he had become
apprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Grandther,” she said, running trustingly toward
him and beginning already to cry, from her stress
of emotions. “I am so glad you have come back to
protect me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Protect you? Protect you?” he almost screamed,
clutching her by the shoulders, so fiercely that the cold
and the pain which he caused seemed to penetrate her
through and through. “What madness have you committed?
What have you done? The charter,—the
charter—the charter!—you shall save the charter! Do
you hear me? You shall keep your promise and
save the colony!” He shook her till the girl was
gasping. She could think of nothing but a hideous
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he hasn’t told you, Grandther,” she cried. “If
you knew the truth you would turn him from the door!
I have seen poor Hester and her baby. I cannot bear
to think of him—I should die!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you—you traitor!” stammered the old man,
in his mania. “You—you betray the colony! You
are mad, mad! You promised. You made your own
conditions. You have deceived me. You would play
us false, now—now, when our liberties are taking heart.
But you shall not! What? You come home here
with this silly story, you—you, the daughter of a
Donner—and ready to tear up the charter for your
silly notions. No—no! no! no!—you shall marry
this man! You shall keep this your bargain! The
charter—you shall save the charter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but, Grandther, the story is true,” said Garde,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>wringing her hands. “He is the one that is false. And
I thought you would hold me too precious for such a
thing as——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough!” commanded the crazed old man. “My
word—the colony’s word—has been given. The bargain
shall be kept. This has gone too far already. To
think that for one moment you would so jeopardize the
charter! I am stricken with shame at your want of
honor at this crisis of our liberties!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde still failed to believe she heard her grandfather
correctly. She still hoped his impatience would abate
sufficiently for her to tell of what she had seen. It
could not be possible that a Puritan, so high-minded
and strict for moral conduct, could know what she
knew and still insist upon this infamous marriage. To
her, at that moment, it was virtue and honor that were
all important to be saved, the charter and the colony
that had become insignificant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you had touched that little dead baby,” she said.
“If you had heard Hester begging, Grandther—oh,
you would have kept your promise,—you would never
coerce me in this terrible——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop! stop!” cried Donner, madly, angered
almost beyond control by this appeal, which was so
unbearably remindful of her mother. “I have not
coerced you, never! You made your promise freely.
The honor of the colony, and more than that, the
safety of the charter, now hang upon your faith in keeping
your own agreement. And you shall keep it—for
the family pride—for the colony’s good name! This
story—what is the woman?—what is her child?—what
is anything, when our liberty and independence tremble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>in the balance? No more—I’ll hear no more of
this,—not a word!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde brushed a wisp of her red-black hair from her
forehead. Her great brown eyes were fastened wide
open by amazement. Her lips alone contained any
color. How red they seemed against the white of her
oval face! Her eyebrows seemed like two curved black
brands on her brow. She looked at her grandfather in
silence. It was positively incredible that he had said
what she had heard, she thought. If Hester and her
child and “everything” were held of so little worth,
why—what of herself? Had it come to this? Was it
admittedly and shamelessly a sacrifice of her very soul,
to a creature only waiting to have his way first before
destroying the charter later?</p>

<p class='c007'>To the pure, natural mind of the girl, Randolph had
become as translucent as water, in his plotted perfidies.
It appeared impossible that any man could still believe
in his lies. She would have spoken of this, but the
sight of the fanatical old man before her, sealed her
lips. She recognized the light in his eyes at last. At
any other moment her pity would have fluttered forth
to him, yearningly, her little mother instinct would
have taken her on the wings of concern to smooth the
care-channeled wrinkles from his brow, but now all
these tenderer emotions had fled away, in fear and awe.
She said nothing further. There was nothing left to
say, nothing that would have any weight against
mania. At length even her gaze fell before the wild
look with which David Donner confronted her, insanely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now then,” said the old man, at length, in a voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>made raucous by his recent passions, “you may go to
bed and prepare your mind for obedience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good night, dear Grandther,” said Garde, by force
of habit, and with nothing more, she passed from the
room.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GOODY’S BOY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> right of Spring to exercise idiosyncrasies of
weather was conceded, doubtless, by the first man.
Spring is well known to be female, for this very proclivity
of changing her mind as to what she will do
next. Having been a spitfire nearly all night, Spring
smiled in the morning, as balmy as if she had caught
the fancy of some tropical zephyr, that hastened rashly
northward to catch her for a kiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first ray of the sun found itself entangled in the
hair of Mistress Merrill. Garde had not slept during
the night. She had not gone to bed, nor had she prepared
her mind for obedience to her grandfather’s
commands. She had spent the hours sitting at the
window, waiting for the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>She now sped swiftly through the unawakened streets,
a prey to a sense of fear that she was being pursued.
From time to time she cast a quick glance across her
shoulder, but there was no one following. There was
hardly a sound, save that a few birds—hardy little
scouts, ahead of the northward-creeping caravan of
summer—twittered and set up rival centers of melody
in the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no hesitation in the girl’s footsteps. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>knew where she was going. Goody Dune’s was the
only place where she could go, with her present resolutions.
She had come to a logical conclusion, as to
what was now to be done, shortly after leaving David
Donner. Her mouth was firmly set, where determination
had come to abide.</p>

<p class='c007'>As always, she found Goody stirring about, with her
door wide open, when she came to the tidy little home.
Goody beheld her coming before she reached the gate.
Peering into her face knowingly, the old woman gave a
little shake to her head. She was adept at deciphering
the hieroglyphics which human emotions write upon
brows and lips and eyes, especially in the faces of the
young.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So your grandfather insists and you are going to
run away?” she said, as Garde came eagerly up the
garden path to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Garde, in some awe of the wise old
woman and her means of acquiring knowledge, “and I
want you to help me,—oh, you must help me—just as
fast as you can! How did you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could see that you were deeply troubled, and I
know exactly what a girl like you would do,” said
Goody. “I was the same kind of a girl, once, myself.
Now tell me, first, where are you going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Garde, “I think to Plymouth,
to my aunt Rosella.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would do well to make up your mind on that
point,” said Goody. “And how are you going, shall
you sail, or ride, or walk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I shall run,” said Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you walk it will last longer,” said the old woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>with just a suspicion of a smile. “Then, those two
points being settled, have you brought anything to eat,
in your pocket?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—no, I didn’t wait for anything. I shan’t want
anything to eat for days. I don’t feel like eating, and
I don’t know when I ever shall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And no blankets to sleep in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, Goody, how could I?” said Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me see; it is something like forty or fifty miles
to Plymouth,” Goody mused. “Have you thought how
it would look if a young woman were seen, running
night and day for sixty miles? You know many people
walk from Plymouth here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Garde, eagerly. “That is the only
trouble. I want you to do something for me, or tell
me what to do. Everybody would see a girl and if
Grandther were told, he would have me caught and
brought back—and I would rather die!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody laughed at her now, more than half gaily.
Her own eyes twinkled with delight over the venture.
“What would be the good of all the things my friends
have given me, all these years, if I did not use them at
such a time as this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, have you got anything I could really use?”
Garde responded. “What is it? What can you do?
I mustn’t wait,—they will catch me, just as sure as the
world!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I make you invisible,” chucked Goody. She
dived into a chest she had opened and began to paw, in
an orderly manner, at a heap of clothing which the box
contained. She presently drew forth a complete suit of
clothing for a boy. “There,” she continued, “go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the next room and put those on, as fast as ever you are
a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those?” said the astonished Garde. “But these
are——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know. They will make you invisible—as a
girl. Do you wish to be seen? If not, go and put
them on and let me get at something else. We still
have other fish to fry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But——” started Garde, when Goody pushed her
into the next apartment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody continued to rummage in the chest, producing
a hat, much the worse for age, a pair of stout shoes, a
stick and a large, red handkerchief. Into this handkerchief
she knotted a number of slices of bread, some
pickles and some cold meat. She then secured it on
the end of the stick, and dropped inside it a little wad
of money, tied in a parcel by itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde now returned, blushing as red as a rose and
bending her legs inward at the knee most shyly,
although anything prettier could hardly be conceived,
and there was no one present save the old woman to
look, anyway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear me!” said the jackdaw. “Oh dear me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stand up stiffly on your pins,” commanded Goody.
“You are not invisible as a girl at all. Come, now, be
a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—Goody——” gasped Garde. “I—I really
can’t——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you can. You must,” corrected the old
woman. “Or else you can give up running away
altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, no!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Then do as I tell you. Feet more apart, knees
stiff. That’s better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, I feel—I feel so—so cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where, in your face? Nonsense. Now try on
this hat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody adjusted the hat. It was much too small to
cover all of Garde’s glorious hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This will have to come off,” said the old woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” was all Garde could reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It did seem a pity, but the business in hand was
altogether grim. The scissors snipped briskly. The
hat presently covered a quaint, pretty head with close-cropped
locks. Garde caught the gleam in Goody’s eyes,
for Goody could not but admire her for a most handsome
and irresistible boy, and again the blushes leaped
into her cheeks, and those tell-tale knees began to try to
hide one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody shook her head. “Any one would still know
you for Garde Merrill,” she confessed, “whether they
had ever known you before or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what shall I do? I might as well go back
to my own clothes,” said the girl eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remain where you are,” instructed her mentor.
“If you are going to run away successfully, you must
muster up your courage. But perhaps you prefer to go
back to——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I’ll——do anything,” interrupted Garde. A
sudden horror of the thought of going back, or of being
caught and taken back, to Randolph and all the rest of
it, put good steel into her shoulders and some also into
her legs. “Please make haste and let me be starting,”
she added. “They may be coming at any moment!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Goody lost but little time in thinking. She produced
a cup, from her shelf of decoctions, and dabbling her
finger into its contents she proceeded to stain the girl’s
face a rich brown color, which made her more handsome
than ever, if possible, but which masked her so
completely that her own reflection would not have
known her. The brown stuff went into her pretty ears
and all around her plump pretty throat and even on top
of her eyelids as they were closed, for Goody was something
of an artist. When she had finished, she regarded
her work critically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The angel Gabriel wouldn’t know you now, himself,”
she said. “When you wish to get it off, use vinegar.
Take your stick and your little pack, put it over
your shoulder, so, and now you are ready. Would you
like something to eat before you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no,” gasped the girl, frightened half out of her
wits, at the prospect of going forth into the world with
two pretty, visible legs to walk withal. “I—I couldn’t
eat anything. I—wait a minute. I—I think I would
like a little drink of water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody gave her a dipper full, of which she took one
miniature sip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I—do I look—terrible?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look like a farmer’s boy—a lout of a country
lad,” said Goody. “So, good-by, young man. My
last word is, forget you have got any legs, or you will
surely be detected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Legs!” said the jackdaw, glad of a new word.
“Legs! Legs!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t—wear anything—over them, could I?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>said Garde, timidly, having jumped when Rex croaked
so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can wear a wedding gown over them, if you
prefer,” said the old woman, grimly, and suggestively.
“I really expected you to do better than this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well—I will!” said the poor child, resolutely.
“Good-by, dear Goody. I shall always love you, more
than ever, for this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody kissed her, as she bent affectionately forward,
and patted her motherly on the back. “That’s a good
boy,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She opened the door and Garde went forth. The
open air made her conscious of her attire instantly.
But she did her best, shy and unboyish as the effort
was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I forgot to ask,” she said, glad to get one more
moment in which to get ready. “How is Hester?
How was she when you saw her last?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody’s face darkened. “I saw her the first thing
this morning,” she said. “Some one must have called
last night, after I left. Hester is dead.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A GREENWOOD MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam Rust</span>, sailing northward, grew more and more
hearty once again with every day, although his pulse-beat
quickened almost hourly, with a fever of impatience
which began to fasten itself upon him. He was
quite himself again, long before the ship arrived at the
port of New York. But the beef-eaters were a sorry
pair, for the sea still took its revenge upon them for
Adam’s total disregard of its powers, and the passage
had been exceptionally rough.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was no more than natural that Pike and Halberd,
on arriving as far as New Amsterdam, should desire to
have done with the boisterous Atlantic. Adam, on the
other hand, was in such a fever to go on to Boston that,
had no ships been available, and no other means possible,
he would have been tempted to swim. As it was,
there was no vessel putting for the north to any point
beyond Plymouth for a week, so that Adam determined
to sail that far and either to catch another captain
there, who would convey him onward, or to walk the
remaining distance alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters, seeming absolutely in need of a rest
from their adventures on the water, reluctantly saw
the “Sachem” depart without them, they in the meantime
remaining with Captain William Kidd, at his New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>York home, expecting to go on to Boston with him
later. This had been the first time that Rust had been
more glad than otherwise to be for a brief season without
his faithful followers. But never before had the
conditions of his going to Boston been the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, on a fine day in April, Adam found himself
landed in the old town, of which he had no pleasant
memories. He would have confined his inspection of
and visit to Plymouth to the docks, had not a hurried
tour of inquiry elicited the information that no vessels
were due to sail to Boston for two or three days. To
remain in the place for such a time as that was not to
be thought of on any account.</p>

<p class='c007'>Providing himself with a small parcel of food, at one
of the taverns, Adam was soon striding through a street
of the town, which he remembered vividly as one
wherein he had walked on a former occasion, as a captive
boy, in a procession of fanatical Puritans. The
memory was far from being pleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would have avoided the place, had he known his
way sufficiently well, but before he knew it was so
very near, he had come to that square in which
the stake with King Philip’s head upon it had once
been set.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at the plain surroundings of the locality
with a reminiscence of melancholy stealing upon him.
He fancied he saw the precise spot where the stake had
stood. It brought back a flood of memories, of his
days spent with the Wampanoags, his companionship
with King Philip, the war and then the end. The
sequent thought was of his first glimpse of Garde, held
in her grandfather’s arms and looking across the bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of merciless faces with a never-to-be-forgotten sympathy
in her sweet, brown eyes. Dwelling then in fondness
upon the recollection of his first meeting with William
Phipps, the rover felt that, as his last sadness here had
been an augury of better times to come, so this present
moment might presage a happiness even greater. With
this comforting thought to spur him on to Boston, he
quitted the square and was soon leaving the outskirts
of Plymouth behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spring seemed to be getting ready for some great
event. She was trimming herself with blossoms and
virgin grass, and she was warm with all her eagerness
to make herself lovely. Adam opened his mouth to
breathe in the fragrance exhaled by flirt Nature. He
walked swiftly, for there was resilience under foot as
well as in his being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Garde were somewhere near, the day could
hardly be lovelier,” he said, half aloud. “She must
be breathing in this direction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His glance was invited here and attracted there.
Wherever it rested, Nature met it with a smile. Adam
felt like hugging a tree, yet no single tree was that
elusive spirit of Nature which he so longed to clasp and
to hold in his arms. But if he was mocked by the
ethereal presence of beauty too diffuse to be held, by a
redolence too subtle to be defined, and by bird notes too
fleeting to be retained, yet he was charmed, caressed,
sublimated by the omnipresence of Nature’s loveliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>At noon he was ten good miles from Plymouth and
trailing his sword through a wood, where one could
feel that some goddess of intangible and exquisite entity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>had just escaped being seen, by fleeing into the
aisles of the trees, leaving an aroma of warmth, pine-breath
and incense to baffle bees behind her. Where a
little brook tinkled upon pebbles, for cymbals, he got
down on his knees and had a long drink. Hearing
voices, where some party seemed approaching, he arose
and went forward, presently coming to a cross-road in
the forest, where he beheld a scene that aroused his
momentary indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It amounted to little. Three young country clods
had evidently been pursuing a fourth young fellow, who
was scarcely more than a boy, and shorter than any in
the group, and now, having come up to him, at the
cross-roads, had “cornered” him up against a tree and
were executing something like an Indian war-dance
about him, as he stood attempting to face all three
at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>They began to yell and to run in at their captive,
who was striking at them awkwardly and not more than
half-heartedly with a stick, in order, apparently, to
prevent them from snatching away his hat. It was entirely
too unequal, this sham combat, to accord with
Adam’s notions of fair play. He started to run toward
the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here!” he shouted. “Here, wait a bit,—I’ll take
a hand, to make it even.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The youth against the tree saw him coming before
the others were aware of his presence. When Adam
shouted, however, they turned about quickly enough,
and yelling in added delight at being chased, they made
off briskly, running back on the cross-road, the way
they had come.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Adam strode more leisurely toward the boy who
remained leaning, in obvious confusion of emotions,
against the tree. He saw a remarkably handsome,
brown-complexioned youth, with delicate features, large
eyes, that gazed upon him in wonder, and exquisitely
rounded legs, one of which was nervously bent inward
at the knee.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately she had seen him before he came close.
Therefore the little involuntary cry of gladness which
had risen to her lips, had been too faint for him to
catch, at a distance. Then in the moment when her
persecutors had been scampering away, she had grasped
at the opportunity to control her emotions to the extent
of deciding, in one second of timid and maidenly
thoughts, that never, never would she reveal herself to
Adam, if she could help it, while dressed in these awful
garments. She must act the boy now, or she would
perish with mortification. Luckily the blush that leaped
to her cheeks was masked by Goody’s brown stain.
Nevertheless she panted with excitement and her bosom
would not be quiescent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning,” said Adam, coming forward and
doffing his hat, which he felt that he must do to a
youth so gentle and so handsome. “You were making
a very pretty fight, but it lacked somewhat of vigor.
The next time, slash this way, and that way; guard
against assault with your other arm, so, and do your
cutting at their heads.” He had drawn his sword with
which to illustrate, and flourished it lustily at the imaginary
enemy, after which he added: “Now then,
who are you any way, and where are you bound?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Good—good morning,” faltered Garde, in a voice
scarcely more than audible. “I am—I am not used to
fighting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I should say not,” said Adam, trying to make
his voice delicate and sweet, in imitation of hers.
“You must speak up, boy, the same as you would fight,
roaring thus: ‘What ho, varlets!’ on your right, and
‘Have at you, knaves!’ on your left. Shatter my hilt!
I haven’t seen so girlish a boy since Will Shakspeare’s
play. Stand out here and let us get acquainted, for I
think I shall like you, though you do fight and roar so
ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Immensely relieved to find that he did not suspect
her identity, Garde summoned all the courage which
ten days away from home had sprouted in her being.
Moreover, she knew that if the deception was to be
made successful, she must act her part with all her
ability. She therefore left the tree, against which she
had continued to lean and stood forth, with what bravery
she could muster.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who may you be?” she managed to inquire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, that’s better,” said Adam. “Don’t be afraid
to speak up. A dog that barks at once seldom has need
to bite. And you have the making of a man in you
yet. You could be taller, but let that pass. You have
fine, sturdy legs; your eye is clear. Why, you have
nothing to blush for. What ails the lad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The red beneath the brown stain was too ardent to be
hidden. Garde’s gaze fell before his admiring look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—haven’t told me your name,” she faltered,
heroically striving to stand stiffly and to conjure a voice
to change the subject withal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“So I haven’t,” Adam agreed. “I asked you for
yours first, but no matter. I am a mad lover, on my
way to Boston. My name is Rust, with a spice of the
old Adam thrown in. If you are going in the same
direction, I shall be glad of your company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was going in the same direction. She had
never reached so far as Plymouth. Footsore and weary,
she had trudged along, going less than ten miles a day,
stopping at night with the farming people, the wives of
whom she had found most kind, and so at last had arrived
at a farm near by these cross-roads, unable to go
any further. She had therefore rested several days, and
only this very morning she had learned, by word from
another traveler, that David Donner, suddenly afflicted
by the double woe of finding her gone and himself
cursed by Randolph, who had immediately set in motion
his machinery for depriving Massachusetts of its charter,
was on his back, delirious and ill, perhaps unto
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was going back, all contritely, yearning over the
old man, who had taken the place of her parents for so
many years, and weighted down with a sense of the
wretchedness attending life. It was not that her resolution
to escape Randolph had abated one particle of
its stiffness, that she was turning about to retrace her
steps, it was merely that her womanly love, her budding
mother-instinct, her loyalty and gratitude for her grandfather’s
many years of kindness and patience,—that all
these made no other thought possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now to learn that Adam was traveling to Boston
also, that she should have him for her strong protector
and comrade, this filled her with such a gush of delight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>that she with difficulty restrained herself from crying,
in joy, and the tendency to give up and lean upon his
supporting arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>At sight of him, indeed, before her mortification had
come upon her, for the costume, in which it seemed to
her she would rather be seen by any other person in the
world than Adam, she had nearly run to his arms and
sobbed out her gladness. It would have been so wholly
sweet to obey this impulse. Her love for the big, handsome
fellow had leaped so exultantly in her breast, again
to see him and to hear his voice, when she had been so
beset with troubles. But she had denied herself splendidly,
and now every moment strengthened her determination
to play her part to the end. Yet what joy it
would be to travel back to Boston, through the greenwood,
by his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>And being not without her sense of humor, Garde
conceived many entertaining possibilities which might
be elicited from the situation, the standpoint of man
to man being so wholly different from anything heretofore
presented to her ken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she said, in answer to Adam’s last remark,
“I am going to Boston—or near there,—but you may
find that I cannot walk fast, nor very far, in a day.
My walking will doubtless prove to be like my fighting.
So that if you are so mad with—with love, and so eager
to hasten, perhaps——” and she left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Adam, pulling his mustache smartly,
“I confess I am a bit hot on foot, and so you would be,
young man, if by any good fortune you knew my sweetheart,
yet I like you well enough, and my lady has such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>a heart that she would counsel me to go slower, if need
be, to lend any comfort or companionship to a youth so
gentle as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure she would,” said Garde, readily enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you, though? One would think you knew
her,” said Adam. “Don’t plume yourself on this
matter so prematurely. Come, let us start.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One moment, please, till I can tie my shoe,” said
Garde, who felt such merriment bubbling up in her
heart that she was constrained to bend downward to the
ground quickly, to hide her smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam stood waiting, glancing around at the woods,
wondering which way his heart had flown, on its lightsome
wings, in that temple of beauty. Garde looked
up at him slyly. He was dressed in great brown
boots, that came above his knees, brown velvet trousers,
a wine-colored velvet coat, with a leather jerkin over
it, sleeveless and long enough to reach to the tops
of his boots, almost, and on his head he wore a large
slouch hat, becoming and finishing to his striking
figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was looking at the back of his head rapturously
when he started to turn, to see why she made the tying
process so deliberate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am ready,” she said, cheerily, springing to her
feet. “Is this the road?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By all the promptings of my heart, it is,” said
Adam. “But, by the way, you have not yet told me
your name, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,—why—why my name is—John Rosella.” She
had thought of her aunt’s first name, on the spur of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the moment, and John had been the simplest and first
thing which had popped into her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Rosella,” repeated Adam. “It sounds like
Spanish. That would account for your dark complexion.”
He looked at her critically. “Yes, you are a
nice, gentle boy. Have you ever been in love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With—with a girl? never!” said Garde, trembling
with delight and fear of being detected, especially if
she answered too many questions. “Do tell me all
about your lady—lady love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a bit too precious to tell to any man,” Adam
assured her, gravely. “And yet, you are so nearly like
a girl that I can almost tell you about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is her name?” asked Garde, catching her
breath in little quick gasps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her name? Ah, I hardly tell it to myself, often.
But her name would sound sweet in these woods. Her
name is—now, mark you, don’t you ask me to repeat it
again. Never mind her name, anyway.... Well,
it’s Garde. You will have to be contented with that.
Ah, but she is the sweetest, most beautiful little woman
in the world. Her loveliness goes all through, the same
as beauty is everywhere in these woods. It’s her nature
to be lovely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice became an utterance of melody. It seemed
a part of the forest tones. He had taken off his hat,
for in his mind Garde stood before him, a smiling
dream, even as Garde actually walked beside him, a
smiling reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is she tall?” said Mistress Merrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, somewhat taller than you,” said Adam, “Being
gentle and likeable you might make one think upon her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>but her voice is sweeter than yours, and, well—she is a
girl, and you are merely girlish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you loved her long?” said Garde, again casting
her gaze upon the ground, as she walked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Years!” said Rust. “I have loved her all my life,
for I never began to live till I saw her first, and I loved
her the moment I saw her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And does she love you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, now you approach forbidden ground. It would
be a sacrilege for me to prate—even here in these woods—of
her sweet thoughts. I have told you too much already.
You are a very devil of a boy, to have gotten so
much from me, touching on this subject. I’ll be sworn,
I don’t know why I have let you draw me out like this.
But I stop you here. It is no concern of yours whether
she likes me or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” said Garde. Then she added slyly, “I should
think she would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you and warn you, in a breath, young
man,” Adam replied. “You have gotten the best of
me already. Let good enough alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde loved him the more for the sacredness in which
he held her name and the inclination of her heart. She
loved him for the modesty which crept into his speech
and deportment when least expected. Loving him
thus, so fully, and in this realm, so made for the growth
of tender passions, she found it difficult to cease her
questions. It was so wholly delightful to hear him
repeat, again and again, how he loved her. She was,
however, obedient by nature, and now cautious by circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you will tell me of your travels,” she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>this subject being next in importance to hearing of his
great affection. “I am sure you could relate much of
interest, if you are so minded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how shall you know I have traveled?” said
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—” Garde found herself confused, having
thoughtlessly spoken on a matter of which she did
actually know, yet of which she must seem to be in
ignorance. “Why—I would know this from your appearance—your
dress, to which the young men here
are not accustomed. Have you not recently come from
over sea?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have,” said the rover, satisfied with her answer.
“I went away seeking my fortune—which still remains
to be sought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, well, never mind,” said Garde, who for the
moment was his partner, to share all his disappointments.
“I mean—I mean you don’t seem to mind,”
she added. “I should like to hear you tell about your
adventures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, who felt that he could talk to this boy by the
hour, was nothing loath to narrate his wanderings, the
more especially as he had always found it difficult sufficiently
to praise his friend William Phipps. Therefore,
as they walked onward together, Garde thrilling
with her love, and turning her eyes fondly upon him,
whensoever he was unaware, Adam told and retold of
the fights, the hopes, the storms, the success in England,
and the illness which had finally given him his
leave to go home to his sweetheart.</p>

<p class='c007'>No lover of Nature ever lingered more fondly over
the sighs of trees, the fanning by of fragrant zephyrs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>or the love-tales sung by the birds, than did Garde on
his every word. And, inasmuch as she could not cling
to his arm, when he recited the perils through which he
had come, she artfully coaxed him back to declarations
of love for his sweetheart, from time to time, to give
some satisfaction to her yearning.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LOVE’S TRAPS FOR CONFESSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Some</span> time before nightfall, the two having shared
their luncheons together and wandered on, through
the delightful patches of sunlight, slanting through
the trees, they came upon one of the farms where
Garde had already tested the hospitality of the good
people residing by the highway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, by a little dexterity, and through Adam’s
generosity toward the delicate boy, to whom he had
taken such a fancy, Garde occupied the spare apartment
she had made her own when headed in the other
direction, and Adam contented himself in the hay-loft
of the barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning they were up betimes, to greet another
smiling sun, and so resumed their leisurely
journey toward the north. At noon they halted as before,
and made a meal of the stock of bread and other
provisions they had been able to secure at the farm-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde sat upon a mossy bank, while Adam reclined
on a stone, somewhat below her woodland throne.
Adam looked at her so long and so steadfastly that she
grew most uneasy, lest he were about to pierce her
disguise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“What are you looking at?” she said, with an
attempt to be boyishly pert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was looking at your legs,” said Adam, frankly.
“They are uncommonly symmetrical, but a shade too
pretty for a boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde immediately bent the plump objects of interest
underneath her and sat on her heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You find a great deal of fault with me,” she said,
a little vexed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s because you have faults, as a boy,” Adam told
her, honestly. “You know, my lad, you could be a
bit sturdier and none the worse. And yet, I like you
immensely as you are. Perhaps if you were changed,
you would lose some charm and spoil it all. I shall have
to let you be, and content myself with you as you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you,” said Garde, already smiling at
him again, to herself. “Then please make no more
remarks about me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About your legs? Well, I won’t, since you appear
so sensitive about them. Mind you, they will do well
enough, after all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall we go on?” Garde asked him. She was a
little weary and would have been glad of further rest,
but she found she was much more comfortable when
they were walking side by side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was up at once, for walk they never so fast, he
felt he could by no means come up with his thoughts
and desires, which had run so far ahead of them always.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind what I say,” said he, as they resumed
the onward march. “I have to have my say out,
when I think it. And you know you do puzzle me
constantly.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“I don’t see why, or how,” said Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s because I seem to think I have seen you somewhere
before. And yet I know that is impossible,
hence I am driven to think of your girlishness, for an
explanation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde said: “I think this is very much in your
imagination, Adam Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit of it,” corrected her comrade. “You
were patterned for a girl, my boy, depend upon it.
There was some mistake, or some bit of trickery, when
you became one of us. Why, a man couldn’t even
think a little oath, in your presence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then is it not better that I was raised somewhat
after the manner of girls?” said Garde, complimented
as much by the reverent tone in his voice as by what he
had said. “Does not the rearing I have known serve
some good purpose, if what you say is so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my faith, yes. But then you do admit that
you were treated in your younger days, somewhat as a
girl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope it is no shame to confess this is so,” she
answered, looking down on the ground to hide the
dancing of her eyes. “I was treated somewhat in this
manner and I was even dressed as a girl, at times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, that accounts for your bashfulness and so
forth. But you need not blush for this. Bless your
heart, a man’s the better for it, if he has something of
the woman in his heart—and even in his hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to hear you say so,” murmured the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, it’s all right,” said Adam magnanimously.
He looked at her with frank admiration. “Only it is
something of a pity you were not a girl, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Oh. But why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because you would be such an one as a man could
love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But not you, Adam Rust. You have said you love
a sweetheart already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do—mightily! But if you were a girl I would
enjoy finding a man worthy to love you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this is unseemly. You forget that I am a
boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for some reason or other, it is easy to forget
that. But I was merely supposing. Say that a man
had come along when you were dressed as a girl—why,
what then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What then indeed,” said she, with some spirit,
“would you have talked like this to me, of—of love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I wouldn’t,” said Rust, stoutly enough. “It
would then have been quite another matter. As it is,
you play the deuce with my brain and fancy. I start
in to talk to you as man to man, and then I think you
are almost better fitted to be a girl—and you admit
you were raised somewhat in that manner, so what can
one expect?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what if your sweetheart heard you speaking
thus?” said Garde, who was enjoying the situation
the more for the very danger of it. “Should you like
to have her hear you telling me I should have made a
girl that a man could—could love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You being a boy, why not?” Adam made answer.
“Ah, she is too present in my thought and feeling for
me to say anything I would be loth for her to hear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had arrived at the edge of a brook which was
somewhat swelled by the snow, back on the hills, melting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>in the genial warmth of the sun. It was nothing
for Adam to stride across, stepping from rock to rock,
but Garde hesitated, her femininity uppermost in a
moment, despite her utmost efforts to be boyish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, give us your hand,” said big Adam, turning
back to help her over. “Now, then, jump!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thrilling with the delight of his warm, strong fingers
closing so firmly on her own, Garde came across the
brook in safety and then reluctantly released her grip
from his.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had not escaped unscathed from this contact
of love, with which she was fairly thrilling. He looked
at her oddly, when they were safe again on the further
side. Garde caught her breath, in fear that she had
betrayed herself at last, in that moment of weakness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are too much for me, John,” Adam admitted,
shaking his head in puzzlement. “You are a strange
boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought it was all explained,” Garde replied,
anxious to get him quieted on the subject. “How far
should you say it is to Boston?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I begin to work it out a little,” the man
went on, musingly. “It’s because you remind me of
some one I have known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I?” said Garde, half afraid of her question.
“Of whom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t quite know,” he confessed, looking at her
earnestly. “And yet I ought to be able to tell. It
was some one I liked, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As much as you did your sweetheart?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam seemed not to hear this question. “Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>complexion,” he resumed, “makes me think of a sweet
maid I knew at Jamaica.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet your eyes are like those of a lovely French
damsel that I met, one time.” Here he sighed.
“Your hands bring back a memory of a charming
Countess at the court of Charles. Some of your ways
make me think of a nice little Indian Princess I once
knew; while your ankles—but you don’t care to hear
about your ankles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was duly shocked. She knew not what to
think of Adam, who was revealing such astonishing
epochs in his life. This was terrible. Yet she wished,
or almost wished, he had gone on, just a little further,
though she dared not encourage him to do so, right as
it might be for her to know it if his heart had strayed
elsewhere, at any time during his absence. She was
alarmed, curious, piqued. She forgot that she was a
boy to whom he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems to me,” she presently answered, “that I
remind you of nothing but the ladies and maids of these
countries where you have traveled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you don’t remind me of the lads, that I admit,”
said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde made up her mind to profit by the occasion.
She piled her little courage up to the top-most mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who was the little maid of Jamaica?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, she was as sweet a little thing as ever prattled
Spanish,” Rust replied, with a reminiscent look in his
eyes. “You would have liked her, I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde entertained and reserved her own opinion on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>that point. “Well—did she like you?” she asked,
indifferently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes, she said she did, and I am sure you could
depend upon her to tell the truth. She used to like to
sit on my knee, dear little thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde gasped. It was fortunate that Adam’s mind
was occupied with memories. His perfidy was coming
forth finely. She knew not whether she wished to cry
or to stamp her foot in anger. She controlled her impulses
heroically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About how old was she?” was her next question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Three, I should say,” said Adam. “She was a
pitiful little thing, more than pretty. In a way she
made me think of Garde, so I couldn’t help but like
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde was flooded, all through her being, with feelings
of love and penitence. To think that she had entertained
for a moment a notion that Adam—and
yet, stay, there were the others,—dames and countesses.
They could not all have been mere tots of children.
Then she wondered if it were fair, thus to try to trap
the poor fellow and take advantage of him, to make him
confess these subjects as to another man. Of course for
his own good it might be better to let him tell. And
she would understand him so much more thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was the French damsel only three also?” she summoned
courage to inquire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear, no. She was three and ninety, but still
sprightly in the minuet and with eyes that could easily
have lighted the sun again, had he chanced to go out.
I shouldn’t have been sorry to have her for a mother—except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>that I flatter myself I had a better one—once
upon a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde would have felt like a coward indeed, had she
desired to ask him of any of the others. Having done
him a little measure of injustice, she made it up to him
by loving him the more, now that she found him so innocent.
Nevertheless she had ears to listen with when
he volunteered some information about the countess he
had seen and admired at the court of Charles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It turned out, however, that he had merely seen her
safely married to one of his royal friends, for whose
happiness he had the most sincere of wishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde felt her spirit of daring and merriment return.
It was so tempting to play around the point of her identity
that she could not altogether resist the impulse of
her nature, to keep him talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I seem to be happy in reminding you of many persons,”
she said. “But I think I would rather remind
you of some one else. Since you claim to be so much
in love, it would compliment me more if I could remind
you of your Mistress Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you would,” said Adam, “only that I am
getting so near to Boston that such a reminiscence, in
a boy, would be sheer impertinence.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A HOLIDAY ENDED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Having</span> the fortune to be overtaken by a good-natured
farmer, who was trotting his horses northward,
along their road, from a trip to market, the travelers
got the benefit of a lift that landed them within a few
hours’ walk of Boston. However, as the farmer’s journey
ended where there were no accommodations, and
there was still another hour of light, which would suffice
to bring them to a small hostelry, where Garde
knew she could make such arrangements as she desired,
they tramped onward as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>With every step that brought them further toward
their destination Adam waxed more and more impatient
to hurry, while Garde found her courage and her
footsteps lagging.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had momentarily forgotten her troubles, in the
joy of being with Adam, strolling for hours through
the vales of peace and loveliness, but now her tribulations
returned, with compound interest. She yearned
over her smitten grandfather, yet she feared for what he
might do, when he should see her again within his reach,
for if he had been well-nigh insane when she saw him
last, how much more violent he might now have become.</p>

<p class='c007'>She trembled likewise at the thought of Randolph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and the measures of revenge which he might adopt,
backed by the power which was sufficient to uphold or
to overthrow the charter. From these meditations she
was tempted to fly to Adam’s arms and implore his protection.
It afforded her infinite relief to think that he
would at least be near. If the worst came of her returning,
she would manage to go to him, by some
means, she was certain, and under the stress of circumstances
she would not be deemed immodest in beseeching
his protection, for which purpose she would consent
immediately to become his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eager to justify herself in what she had done, refusing
to believe that honor had been as nothing and Randolph’s
promises all important, she framed many introductions
to the subject, before she could finally begin
to question her fellow-traveler upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She then began by reciting to him somewhat of the
news of Boston town. She told of the fear for the
charter, which had become a mania with the older
patriots, of the baleful power of Randolph and of the
culminations which at last he was beginning to work
against the colony. Adam waxed so wroth against
Randolph, whom he remembered distinctly, that she
was much encouraged to go on with a hypothetical case
which she soon invented.</p>

<p class='c007'>She dared not connect the name of Randolph directly
with her story and questions, lest Adam, when he
arrived in Boston, should learn more, concerning the
whole wretched business, and know it was she who had
undergone the ordeal. Also it required a great concentration
of her courage, backed by repeated assurances to
herself that Adam thought her a youth, before she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>could approach the subject in any manner whatsoever.
Yet she knew she would have no such opportunity to
speak to him again with anything like the freedom
which was now possible, and Goody Dune had made
her a sensible young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose,” she finally said, “that a man who had
influence with the King threatened to use all his power
against the colony and its charter, if some young girl
should refuse to become his wife. Would it be her
duty to marry the man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would depend on her spirit of patriotism,”
said Adam. “If she believed she could save the colony
from a grave danger, it seems to me she ought to do
so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—I think so too,” said Garde, honestly. “But
suppose she found out that the man had been very
false.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In what manner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,—that he had deceived another young woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean betrayed some other young woman?”
said Adam bluntly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde averted her gaze and answered: “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, suppose this was so, then what is your question?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The question is, what do you think the first young
woman should do then—after she found out that—that
this was true?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would depend again on the particular young
woman,” said Rust, who believed he was speaking as
man to man, and who knew that when women are
betrayed it is not always the fault wholly of the male-being
in the case. “If she wanted to save the charter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>or anything of that sort, I don’t see how this would
alter the case particularly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wouldn’t excuse the man?” said Garde, turning
pale under her brown stain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had in mind a painful incident which had
occurred in the life of a friend of his in England. “I
might,” he answered. “Possibly a great deal could be
said in defense of the poor devil, in some way or
another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” insisted Garde, somewhat desperately, “if
you were a girl you wouldn’t marry such a man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I were a girl and I loved him,” said Rust, still
thinking of the case of his friend, “why—I think
perhaps I should.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if you hated and loathed him?” Garde almost
cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that is quite a different matter. If hate
entered in, I should welcome any excuse to get away.
In the actual case of which I was thinking, it seems to
me the girl ought to forgive——But I had forgotten
all about the element of the charter, which we were supposing
was to figure in the case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde cared for nothing further about the discussion.
He had justified her, at least partially. She had
always felt that Randolph would have betrayed the
colony, even had she sacrificed herself and Adam, to
marry him, as her grandfather had desired. She was
now a little troubled that Adam could think so nearly
as her grandfather had done; that he could really condone
such a terrible dishonor in a fellow-man. Had it
not been that, under cover of her present disguise she
had proved how true and good her Adam was, she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>have been pained and perhaps worried by his latitude
of thought. She had to finish the subject, so she
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If she—this girl—not only hated the man, but felt
sure he would not keep his promise to do good for the
charter, but would deceive her and every one else, just
as he had deceived the other girl—then what ought she
to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be high time, under those circumstances,”
replied her companion, “to refuse absolutely, or to
ship on the first departing vessel, or to do anything else
that would be quick and to the point.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is just what I think,” said Garde, now well
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s more important for us, my boy, to think of
what we shall do when we arrive in Boston, to-morrow,”
Adam now remarked. “By the way, do you know
anybody there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde hesitated before answering. She had to be
clever. “Nobody there will know me when I get
there,” she said, “unless it is some one I might once
have known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust did not analyze the ambiguity of this reply. He
was engrossed with other reflections.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you got any money?” he asked her next.
“Because if you haven’t you can have the half of mine,—not
much to speak of, but enough to feed you and
put you to bed. I hope to get into some better tavern
than the Crow and Arrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said Garde, looking at him slyly with
a tender light of love in her eyes, “I think I have
enough for a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“If we stop at the same tavern, and have our meals
served together, it will cost you less,” Adam informed
her practically, “and besides, I have grown so fond of
you, my boy, that I should be sorry to lose sight of you,
in the town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the sooner you lose sight of me, the sooner you
will see your sweetheart,” said Garde, with difficulty
restraining her lips from curving in a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, but I shall wish her to know you,” said Adam,
generously. “For to no one else save you have I ever
been able to talk of my love for her sweet self, and this
is something of a miracle. As I think upon it, you do
remind me of her often, by your voice, though it is not
so sweet as hers, as I may have said before, and by
other tokens, which I am at a loss to define. But
because of these things, I would fight for you, and with
her sweet approval.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure of it,” said Garde. “I trust you will
have great joy when you find her again. And you may
tell her for me, if you will, that——well, that she should
love you with her whole soul,——but she does already, I
am sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a kind as well as a gentle boy,” said Adam
to her gravely. “I am glad it could be no matter to
her for me to like you so exceedingly, you being a boy,——but,
boy, you do bedevil my brain with your girlish
ways. I shall never explain you, I’ll be sworn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is where we turn, for the night’s rest,” Garde
replied, avoiding the puzzled look which Rust directed
to her face. “We have had a pleasant journey of it
together. I shall never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s wait till it’s finished before we sum it up,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>said Adam. “To-morrow we have a few more hours,
ere we reach the town, and these may be the pleasantest
of all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet when the boy said good night to him, after their
supper, he felt a strange sense of loss for which he was
wholly unable to account.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning the matter was somewhat explained.
The boy had arisen before the sun and gone on her way
without him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not without a little pang in his heart that the
rover trudged onward, alone.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>IN BOSTON TOWN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Garde</span> fairly ran, when she made her early morning
start. She had not been able to think of any other
solution of the problem of getting back to her own
proper sphere without permitting Adam to become
aware of the whole situation. She had not come to her
resolution to cope with the difficulty thus without many
little sighs of regret and a few little fears of what might
be the consequences. Nevertheless, she had seen the
necessity of prompt action, after which she had felt a
desire only for haste. She was, however, buoyed up
by the glad thought that Adam would not be long behind
her, in his march to town, hence she would soon
be seeing him there, under circumstances which would
make it possible to accept his love and to lean upon
his strong, protecting arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was no more than an hour up in the sky
when she came to the outskirts of Boston and ran
quickly on to Goody Dune’s. Goody was not at all surprised
to see her thus returning. Indeed she had looked
to see her back at least a week earlier. The old woman,
preparing against this moment, had plaited the long locks
of hair which Garde had been obliged to leave behind,
and these she helped the truant to wind upon her head,
with some semblance of natural growth, an effect which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>she heightened by providing a small lace cap, which
made of Mistress Merrill a very demure-appearing little
person.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brown stain rapidly succumbed to Goody’s treatment
with vinegar. Garde emerged from the mask as
rosy and cream white as an apple, for the open air and
the days with Adam had wrought such evidence of
health and happiness upon her that not the dread of
what she might discover at home, nor any excitement
of being in the land of her enemy, could make any paleness
in her face of more than a moment’s duration. She
was too excited to eat, although Goody tried to urge
her to take even a cup of tea, and so she went on to
her grandfather’s house, and let herself in, at the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Granther Donner’s sister had passed away a number
of years before, he had been left quite to himself
when Garde decamped. But when his illness came so
suddenly upon him, Mrs. Soam and Prudence, both
persuaded that Garde was almost, if not entirely, in the
right, appeared dutifully at his bedside as ministering
angels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Garde, upon entering the kitchen, found her
Aunt Gertrude engaged in preparing a breakfast. The
good lady was startled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—Garde!” she gasped. “Oh, dear me, is it
really you? Child, where have you been? Oh, David
is very ill indeed. I am so glad you have come home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came because I heard he was ill,” said Garde, who
was more calm than might have been expected. “I
didn’t know you were here. It was real good of you to
come, dear aunty. I suppose you will scold me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was all a terrible thing,” said her aunt, “but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>John says he thinks Mr. Randolph meant to take away
our charter anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am sure of it!” cried Garde, so glad to hear
of a partisan. “If I hadn’t believed that, I don’t
think I should ever have run away. Oh, thank you, so
much, dear aunty! I am so glad. God bless Uncle
John! I knew I was right!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But your uncle and all of us are very sad,” her
aunt proceeded to add. “They don’t think we will
have the charter through the summer. It is a terrible
time, but they all say that Randolph must have been
getting ready, or he couldn’t have done so much so
quickly. It is a sad day for Massachusetts. But, there,
run in and see David, do,—but, dearie, don’t be surprised
if he doesn’t seem to know you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dining-room Garde and Prudence met, a moment
later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning, Garde,” said the cousin, without
the slightest sign of emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde kissed her, impulsively. “Oh, I am so glad
to see you, dear!” she said. Indeed love had so wrought
upon her that she felt she had never so cared for any
one before as she did for all these dear ones now.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hastened on to her grandfather, and Prudence
was left there, looking where her cousin had gone and
solemnly wishing she also might do something emotional
and startling.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a few hours only sufficed to reduce the spirit of
wildness and youthful exhilaration which Garde had
brought with her back from the road in the forest. To
hear the old patriot raving, childishly, and crying and
praying over the charter and over Garde as a baby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>which was the way he seemed to remember his grandchild,
was a thing that rent her heart and drove all joy
from the life of care into which she came, in her mood
of penitence and quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days slipped by and became weeks. Prudence
returned to her father at once. Goodwife Soam remained
to help Garde over the crisis, and then she too
left the girl with the stricken old man, who had become
a prattling child, on whom the word “Charter” acted
like a shock to make him instantly insane against his
daughter’s child.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Adam Rust, having come to Boston
in a moment when excitement, despair and bitter feeling,
such as the town nor the colony had ever known
before, and which completely altered the Puritan people,
had heard a garbled story of Randolph’s perfidy
and his attempt to marry Garde which made his blood
boil. Fortunately the fact that Garde had run away
had been kept so close a secret, that more persons had
heard how devotedly she was attending David Donner
than knew any hint of her escapade. Adam having
first paid his respects to Mrs. Phipps, to whom he delivered
the Captain’s messages and letters, had found
himself apartments in a tavern quite removed from the
Crow and Arrow, where he had been able easily to avoid
all his former acquaintances of Boston. He might
have desired to search out Wainsworth, but Henry was
away at Salem. Randolph, of whom Adam naturally
thought, had betaken himself to New York, there to
conclude some details of snatching the charter from
the colony of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once settled, Adam lost no time in searching for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Garde. Thus he was soon made aware of the state of
the Donner household, into the affairs of which it would
have been anything but thoughtful and kind to obtrude
his presence. With a courteous patience he set himself
to wait for a seemly moment in which to apprise Garde of
his reappearance. He told himself that, as she had no
intimation that he had returned to Boston, it would be a
greater kindness to keep himself in the background,
until her trials should be lessened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally all these various matters had somewhat
obliterated from his mind the thoughts of the youth
with whom he had traveled from the environs of Plymouth.
While he was curbing his spirit and his too
impatient love, a message arrived, in care of Goodwife
Phipps, from Captain William Kidd, to the effect that
the beef-eaters, far from recuperating after their voyage,
had become seriously ill, and were begging each day
for the “Sachem.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust had been contemplating the acceptance of an
offer from Mrs. Phipps to assume command at the ship-yard,
the foreman in charge being then arrogating powers
unto himself which were not at all quieting. Adam
reflected that if he took this place he could settle down,
marry his sweetheart presently, and become a sober
citizen.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the advent of the message from the beef-eaters,
he was completely at a loss to know what to do. He
yearned over these faithful companions, whose affection
had been repeatedly demonstrated, under circumstances
the most trying. If they should die while
he remained away, selfishly denying them so little a
thing as his presence, he would never obtain his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>forgiveness. Yet he could not go to New York, or
any other where on earth, without first having at least
seen Garde. Indeed he reflected now that mayhap it
had been a mistaken kindness for him to remain away
from her side so long. Should he not have gone to her
long before, and offered what service he could render
in her trial?</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact he had been kind as it was, for
Garde had hardly enjoyed a moment in which to do so
much as to think of love and her lover. Her grandfather
had occupied her attention day and night.
She had stinted him in nothing, else with her spirit of
penitence upon her—for all that she had helped to
hasten upon him—she could never have had any peace
of mind nor contentment in her soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at last, when the old man was out of danger,
sitting in his chair by the hour, she had time to think
of Adam again and to wonder why it was that he had
never attempted to see her. She answered herself by
saying it was better that he had not done so, but then,
when she suddenly thought that he might have heard
all manner of wild stories, and might indeed have gone
away, angered and not understanding the truth, she
yearned for him feverishly.</p>

<p class='c007'>As if the message of her love flew unerringly to him,
Adam suddenly, in the midst of thinking of going to
the beef-eaters, determined to see his sweetheart, cost
what it might.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LOVE’S GARDEN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>After</span> nearly a week of rain and dull, gray skies, the
weather was again entrancing. The warm, soporific
breeze which played through the house lulled Grandther
Donner off to sleep, as he sat in his chair, staring at
vacancy and rubbing his thumb across the ends of his
fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, responding to the mood of coming summer,
could not resist the impulse to go out into the garden,
which to her would always be associated with her childish
meeting with Adam Rust, and which therefore now
made of her yearning to see him a positive force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it doubtless appeared to her as an answer to
her longing when she felt a presence and glanced up at
the gate, to see him standing there, as he had so many
years before, with two of the pickets clasped in his
big, strong hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart gave a leap that almost hurt, so suddenly
did it send the ecstasy bounding through her veins.
Yet so sublimated was the look on Adam’s face, as,
with parted lips and visible color rising and falling in
his face, he gazed at her, steadfastly, and as one entranced,
that she went toward him as slowly as if
walking might disturb the spell.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of her hands, like a homing dove, came up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>press on her bosom above her heart. She was pale, for
the cares of those weeks had bleached the rose-tints
from her cheeks. Nevertheless, the moment painted
them with vestal flames of love’s own lamp, as she
looked into Adam’s eyes and saw the tender passion
abiding there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam, I prithee come in,” she said, in a soft
murmur, unconsciously repeating what she had said
when first he had leaned upon this gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>As one approaching something sacred, Adam came
in and took her two hands in his. He raised them
slowly to his lips, and then pressed them together
against his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde,” he said, almost whispering. “Garde.
My little Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>They looked at one another and smiled, she through
shining tears. Then they laughed, for there were no
words, there was nothing which could absolutely express
their overflowing joy, but their laughing, which
was wholly spontaneous, came the nearest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I have been so afraid this moment would
never come,” said Garde, presently, when she could
trust herself to speak. “It has been such a long, long
time to wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love you. Garde, dearest, I love you,” said
Adam. “I love to say that I love you. I could say
it all day: ‘Garde, I love you. Garde, I love you,
dear, and love you.’ I have told every star in the
heavens to tell you how I love you, dear. But I would
rather tell you myself. Let me see you. Let me look
at you, sweetheart.” He still held her hands, but at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>arms’ length away, and looked at her blushing face with
such an adoration in his eyes as she had never beheld.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, Adam’s passion had swept her from her feet.
It possessed her, enveloped her form, held her enthralled
in an ecstasy so profound that she gasped to catch her
breath, while her heart leaped as if it were pealing out
her happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were standing thus, oblivions of everything,
when a sour-visaged Puritan, passing by the gate, halted
a moment to look at them malignantly. It was none
other than Isaiah Pinchbecker, the scolding hypocrite
who had danced to Adam’s fiddling, several years before.
He suddenly gave himself a nudge in the ribs.
His eyes lighted up with grim satisfaction. He had
recognized the rover, and with news in his narrow
head he hastened away, prodding himself assiduously
as he went.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, Grandther Donner, whose naps
lasted hardly as long as forty winks, had awakened.
He started from his sleep as if he had suddenly caught
himself neglecting to watch the charter. Glancing
hastily about the room, he missed Garde at once. In
his brain, two cells had broken their walls so that their
substance commingled, till Garde and the charter seemed
at times the same, and always so interlinked that he
dared not let her go a yard from his sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>He tottered to his feet, and rubbing his thumb
diligently across the ends of his fingers, went out at
the open door, toward his grandchild, guided by some
sense which in an animal is often highly developed.
He came upon the scene in the garden just as Adam,
after looking his heart full, nearly to bursting, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>drawn Garde close again, to kiss her hands in uncontainable
joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>At sight of Adam’s costume, which was not a great
departure from that of the Royalists of the day, in
contradistinction from that of the Puritans, David
Donner flew into a violent rage. He raised his two
palsied hands above his head and screamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde!” he cried, “Garde! Kill that man—Kill
him!—kill him! The charter! The King’s
devil! Kill him! He’s ripping the charter to pieces
with his teeth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He came running toward them, clawing his nails
down across his face till he made his pale cheeks bleed,
and tore out little waving filaments, like gossamer, from
his snow-white hair. Almost at their feet he fell full
length, where he struck at the soil and dug in his
finger nails, frantically, all the while making terrible
sounds in his paroxysm, most dreadful to hear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam and Garde had started, he merely alert in the
presence of the unexpected, she in a fear that sent the
color from her face so abruptly that it seemed she must
swoon at once. She uttered one little cry, clung galvanically
to Adam’s fingers for a second, and then bent
quickly down to place her hand on the old man’s
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>His delirious fury lasted but a moment. It then
subsided as quickly as it had come, leaving him limp,
exhausted, dull-eyed and panting like some run-down
animal. A more pitiable sight than he then became, as
he began to weep, shaken by the convulsive sobs which
sometimes possess the frame of a man, Adam hoped he
should never be obliged to witness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Well as he understood that the sight of himself had
precipitated this painful episode, Adam was also now
aware that the old man, for the moment, saw and comprehended
nothing. He therefore lifted him tenderly
up in his arms and carried him into the house, placing
him gently down on a lounge which he readily saw had
been recently employed for the old man’s couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had followed, her hands clasped together, the
look of a tired mother in her face, making it infinitely
sweet and patient.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde, dear, forgive me,” said Adam. “I came
too soon to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh Adam!” she said, sadly. “In a few days, a
week, dear, he is sure to be better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there anything I can do?” said Adam, from
the depths of his distress and sympathy and love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he is coming back to himself. Go, Adam,
please,” said Garde, “don’t wait, dear, please. Come
back to the gate, this evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam went without so much as waiting to say good-by,
for Garde had turned to her grandfather quickly,
and anything further he might have said he abandoned,
when David feebly spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Depressed by the whole affair immeasurably, Adam
was still too exalted by love’s great flight to dwell for
long upon old Donner’s mania. His worries for Garde,
in her tribulations, however, were strewn like sad
flowers of thought through his reverie. He longed to
help her, yet he knew how utterly impossible such a
thing would be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking aimlessly, he came before long to the harbor
shore. The melted emerald and sapphire, which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>sea was rolling against the rocks, with sparkles of captured
sunlight glinting endlessly through and upon
the lazy billows, gave him the greatest possible sense
of delight. He sat down on a rock where the green
velvet moss had dried like fur, after a wetting.</p>

<p class='c007'>No king on a throne ever detected more evidences
of the world’s gladness than did the rover, thinking
away the hours of that balmy afternoon. He forgot
all about dinner, when the sun went down, and he had
nearly forgotten old man Donner, when at length he
started to his feet, in the twilight, in love with the
evening for having come so soon, although half an
hour before he had been thinking the day would never
end.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was soon at the gate in front of Donner’s house,
listening, watching the darkened windows, holding his
breath as every fragrant zephyr trailed its perfumes by,
thinking Garde was coming, preceded by the redolence
attendant on her loveliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he had many such breathless moments of suspense,
in vain. Evening glided into the arms of night.
The hours winged by, on raven wings, and still no
Garde appeared. Adam paced up and down, restoring,
time after time, the picture of Garde as he had
seen her, during those precious few moments before
the interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not conscious of the flight of time. He was
well content to be near where his lady was and to wait
there, knowing that she knew he was waiting, thinking
of her, as he knew she was thinking of him. He
clasped his hands back of his head; then he folded his
arms, the better to press on his heart; then he stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and tossed kisses to the silent house, after which he
again walked back and forth, pausing to listen, and
then going on as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, near midnight, he stood looking up at
the stars, completely absorbed in a dream he was
fashioning to suit himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a faint flutter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam—oh, are you there?” said a sweet voice,
subdued and a bit tremulous. “Oh, I am so glad you
didn’t go away, discouraged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had turned about instantly, a glad sound upon
his lips. In one stride he reached the gate and caught
her two trembling hands where they rested on the
pickets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest!” he murmured to her joyously. “At
last!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can only stop a minute, Adam,” said Garde, who
was quaking a little, lest her grandfather wake and
come again into the garden. “He has been very restless,
and he wouldn’t go to sleep, and he wakes up so
easily! But I couldn’t let you go away like that. And
I have tried to come out five times, but he woke up
every time, and now I must say good night, Adam,
and run right back at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but I love you so,” said Adam, illogically. “If
you must go, though, you must. I know I can never
tell you how much I love you, dearest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam!” she said, expressing more than he
did, poor fellow, in all his protestations. “Oh, dear!
I really must go, Adam. But in about a week I am
sure he will be much better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shan’t I see you for a week?” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“It might be better not,” she answered, “if we could
wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could go down to see my poor old beef-eaters, I
suppose,” Adam mused.</p>

<p class='c007'>In relating his travels, on the road, he had told Garde
of the beef-eaters, so that now, although she said nothing
to betray herself, she understood what he meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then you’ll come back, as soon as you can, in
a few days, or a week?” she asked. “Oh, dear—it is
too bad. But, Adam, I must not remain another single
minute. I must say good night, dear, and run.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had remained on his own side of the gate,
retaining her hands, which he had kissed repeatedly,
till they fairly burned with their tingling. He now
reached over the gate and took her sweet face between
his two big palms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good night, dearest little love,” he said, and slowly
leaning forward, he kissed her, once—then he kissed her
three times more.</p>

<p class='c007'>She started slowly away, looking back at him
lovingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Garde!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped and came fluttering back to meet him.
He had let himself in at the gate with one quick movement.
He took her home to his arms and held her
in breathless joy against his throbbing heart. With
love in her eyes her face was turned upward to his
own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Adam!” she said, with all the fervor of her
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My love! My darling!” he responded.</p>

<p class='c007'>He kissed her again. It was a warm, sweet kiss that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>brought their very souls to their lips. Then he dropped
down on his knee and kissed her hands and pressed
their fragrant palms against his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My love!” he said. “My own love!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She nestled in his arms yet once again. She gave
him the one more kiss that burned on her lips to be
taken, and then she fled swiftly to the house.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE ENEMY IN POWER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam</span> found his faithful beef-eaters on the verge of
the grave. The miserable old rogues had no better
sense than to be pining to death like two masterless dogs.
They had been ill enough, in all conscience, and even
somewhat mentally disordered, but there had been no
sufficient grounds for the pair to believe themselves
abandoned by their “Sachem,” and there had been absolutely
no excuse for them to refuse to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the rascals nearly “wagged” themselves to
pieces when Rust was finally beside them, and the way
they laughed was most suggestively like the glad whimpering
of two dumbly loving animals expressing their
joy. Adam would have scolded the two for having
brought themselves to such a condition of weakness
and bones, only that he had not the heart to do this
justice to the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was, however, no such thing as getting the old
fellows back on their pins in a week, nor yet in two,
nor three. They even hesitated, after he had come,
between running backward toward their long sleep and
coming along with him to vales of renewed health.
They were like affectionate creatures divided between
two masters. The grim visitor had come so near to winning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>them both, with his beckoning, that they appeared
to think it their duty to die.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, however, was a persuasive force. He had won
them away from themselves before; he won them again
on this occasion. Captain Kidd, a braw Scotsman,
who ordinarily dropped his native dialect, having little
affection for his country, his father having suffered tortures
for becoming a non-conformist clergyman, felt he
must needs relapse into something barbaric to express
himself on the beef-eaters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of all the twas that ere twad,” said he, “you’re
muckle the strangest twa.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this he meant to convey that of all the couples
that ever mated, the two old rascals were the oddest
pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The convalescence being a slow affair, Adam was
obliged to give up all thought of returning immediately
to Boston. Yet so hopeful was he that every day
would perform some miracle of restoring the strength
to the muscles and the meat to the bones of his retinue,
that it was not until he had been away from Garde
for more than three weeks that he finally wrote to tell
her of why he had failed to return. But the letter, for
some unknown reason, was never delivered.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, however, what with the fulness of summer
come upon them and the hope which Adam had
inspired in their breasts, the beef-eaters became padded
out to the fulness of their old-time grandeur, and once
more swaggered about and bragged of their prowess.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam’s money had, by this time, dwindled down to
a sum which was not at all difficult to transport from
place to place, nor even from pocket to pocket. Having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>no heart to put the retinue on shipboard, to convey
them to Massachusetts, he sacrificed nearly his
last bit of coin to secure them passage, by coach and
wagon, from Manhattan to Boston. This left him
either one of two expedients for himself. He could
walk, or he could make shift to secure a passage by
vessel, giving work as payment for the favor. He
argued that once in Boston he would accept the position
offered by Goodwife Phipps at the ship-yard, and
hither also would he take his followers, so that by honest
toil they might all be happy and continue their time-sealed
companionship, and desert the rolling-stone business
as an occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not without misgivings that the beef-eaters
accepted this arrangement. But being obedient things
that would willingly have gone into fire, or the sea itself,
at Adam’s command or wish, they meekly bade him
a temporary adieu and saw him depart before them, a
ship being several days ahead of the coach in point of
time for departing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, history had been making fast in
Boston. The crafty Randolph, whose coup had long
been prepared, had returned from New Amsterdam,
bearing a commission from the King of England
declaring the charter null and void and delegating upon
him power to form a new provisional government for
the colony of Massachusetts. Great tracts of territory,
comprising New Hampshire, Maine and other areas,
were lopped off from the province at one fell blow.
Randolph created Joseph Dudley provisional governor,
Dudley having long been seeking his favor, against this
final moment of changes. The courts fell into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>hands of the newly-elected power. The soldiers, constabulary,
everything assumed an ultra-English tone
and arrogance. The people clenched their fists and
wrought their passions up to a point where rebellions are
lighted in a night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet Boston was a loyal town, obedient to its liege
lord and nearly as eager to serve him and to do him
homage as it was to preserve its liberties and the independence,
which gradual development had created and
long usage had confirmed as inalienable, in the belief
of all the patriotic citizens. Stoughton and Bradstreet,
beholding the revolutionary tendency, which would
have plunged the colony most unwisely into a sea of
trouble, submitted to the new order of things, which
for long they had seen coming, inevitably, out of the
malignant spirit in which the Stuart dynasty had
always desired to govern these non-conformist hard-heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many creatures in Boston swift to join
the Tory party, under Randolph, for the plums of
official recognition. Thus this party rapidly assumed
considerable dimensions, and therefore power, to add to
that of which the King himself was the fountain-head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boston at that time was a prosperous town of something
more than six thousand souls. It was substantially
built, if crookedly, for the most part of wood. Yet
there was a fair sprinkling of brick houses along its
cow-path streets, and a few were of stone, which, in
several instances, had been brought to this undeveloped
land from England. The town was distinctly English,
both as to customs and thoughts, but the seeds which
hardihood had sown, were to grow the pillars of Americanism—synonymous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>with a spirit of Democracy sufficient
to inspire the world!</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally Isaiah Pinchbecker became a master-jackal
under the new régime. Psalms Higgler, the lesser
light of lick-spittling, became, by the same token, a
lesser carnivora, but no less hungry to be feeding on
the foe-masters of the recent past. And Pinchbecker,
having found Adam in the town, was alert to find him
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet not even Pinchbecker, with his knife-edge mind,
devoted to evolving schemes of vengeance, could have
comprehended the tigerish joy with which Randolph
remembered Adam Rust, from that morning in the
Crow and Arrow, and with which he now put two and
two together, to arrive at Adam’s relationship with
Garde Merrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph was a subtle schemer, never fathomed by
the Puritans, against whom he displayed such an implacable
hatred. He was far too wise ever to appear as
the point, when a thrust of revenge was to be delivered.
He never for a moment relaxed his obsequious demeanor,
nor his air of injured guiltlessness. Like all men of
power, he had much material, self-offered, from which
to choose his henchmen. He had chosen Pinchbecker
wisely, for a hypocrite, a fawner, and an arrant knave
who could work endless harm, in an underhanded
fashion. But for his more aggressive employment he
attached to his service a great, burly brute, with a face
like a mastiff’s, an intelligence like a sloth’s, and a
courage like that of a badger. This masterpiece of
human animalism responded to the name of “Gallows,”
for once a man had been hanged on his back, as in early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>English-Irish usage, and of this he was matchlessly
proud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam arrived in the midst of that first elation
of Randolph and his following, the like of which
is frequently the cause of reaction so violent as to quite
reverse the fates themselves. But although the Puritans
hated Dudley, almost more than Randolph, for
traitorously joining the party of destruction, their
growlings checked nothing of the all-importance which
the creatures in power felt and made their fellow-beings
feel. A spirit of sullen brooding settled on the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unaware that Rust had been away from Boston,
since he had seen him that day in Donner’s garden
with Mistress Merrill, Pinchbecker had been seeking
for him diligently, ever since Randolph’s return. But
believing that his quarry would be found eventually in
the vicinity of the Crow and Arrow, his field of investigations
was narrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had naturally happened, however, that Adam had
quite forgotten to tell the beef-eaters of his change of
abode in Boston. They would therefore proceed to
the old tavern immediately upon their arrival. He
thought of this before he landed. Having come ashore
at twilight, he made it his duty to stroll to the Crow
and Arrow, for the purpose of leaving a message for
Pike and Halberd, when at last they should come to
the town.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A FIGHT AT THE TAVERN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a quiet time of the day, in a quiet part of the
city. Adam discerned one or two individuals only and
was not concerned with noting that he was suddenly
preceded by a noiseless person, who hastened ahead of
him to the tavern. The rover was much more occupied
in observing the beauties of a horse that stood hitched
to a post across the way from the public house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The animal, a fine bay, imported from England, was
the property of one of Randolph’s followers, a drinking
young dandy with questionable ambitions and many
extravagant tastes. Charmed by the horse’s impatience,
as evinced by his pawing at the ground, Adam was
tempted to get astride his back for a gallop.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, after standing for a moment on the sidewalk,
while his gaze caressed the champing animal, he
turned and passed on into the tavern. Desiring to conclude
his business as speedily as possible, he was somewhat
annoyed to find the way to the bar, in front of
the landlord, completely blocked by a great hulk of a
creature, with a sword loosely girt about his loins, and
two or three others, of whom the rover took less notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By your leave,” he said, politely, not yet suspicious
of the odd silence which had fallen on the company at
his entrance, “I would like to get to the——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“What!” roared the big lout, whom he had slightly
touched upon the arm. “Who the devil are you?
Keep your hands off of me, you fool!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The person on whom Adam looked was Gallows,
whose face, florid almost to being purple, was so
savagely contorted as to comprise an insult in itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My cross-eyed friend,” retorted Adam, whose temper
had risen without delay, “have done looking at yourself,
if you would see no fool. If you will tell me which
hand I put on you, I’ll cut it off, else I may live to see
it rot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The company had turned about at once. Pinchbecker
was there, with his satellite, Psalms Higgler, the
little white-eyed scamp that Adam had once dropped
from the near-by window. The foppish young Englishman,
who owned the horse outside, was likewise in the
party. They all saw the burly Gallows turn to them
hopelessly, befuddled by Adam’s answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You be a fool!” he roared again, his eyes bulging
out of their sockets in his wrath, “and I be the fool-killer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The company guffawed at this, the monster’s solitary
sally of wit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a liar by the fact that you live,” said Rust.
“Bah, you disgust me with the thought of having the
duties, which you have so patently and outrageously
neglected, thrust upon me. Begone. There’s no fire
to roast a barbecue, if I should be minded to spit
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The creature looked again at his fellows, who had
obviously egged him on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He insults you right prettily, good Gallows,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the dandy, who was himself a rascal banished from his
own country. “But he dare not fight you, we can see
it plainly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With you thrown in, I dare say there might be a
moment’s sport in a most unsavory blood-letting,” said
Rust, whose hand went to his sword-hilt calmly. “I
should want some fresh air if I stuck either one of you
carrion-fed buzzards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallows knew by this that it was time to draw his
blade. “You be a fool and I be the fool-killer,” he
roared as before, this being his best hold on language
to suit the occasion. Only now he came for Adam like
a butcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Outside—go outside, gentlemen!” cried the landlord
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go outside!” said the voice of some one who was
not visible. It was Randolph, concealed in the adjoining
room and watching the proceedings through a
narrow crack, where he had opened the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on out, and I’ll fight you!” bellowed Gallows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After you,” said Rust, whose blade was out and
being swiftly passed under his exacting eye. “Go out
first. You will need one more breath than I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The brute obeyed, as if he had to do so and knew it,
receiving Adam’s order like the clod he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other creatures made such a scrambling to see
the show, and otherwise evinced such an abnormal interest
in the coming fight, that Adam had no trouble in
divining that the whole affair had been prearranged,
and that if he did not get killed, he would be arrested,
should he slay his opponent. He concluded he was
something of a match for the whole outfit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“Have at you, mountain of foul meat,” he said, as
he tossed down his hat. “What a mess you will make,
done in slices!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young dandy laughed, despite himself, from his
place by the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallows needed no further exasperations. He came
marching up to Rust and made a hack at him, mighty
enough and vicious enough to break down the stoutest
guard and cleave through a man’s whole body as
well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust had expected no less than such a stroke. He
spared his steel the task of parrying the Gallows’ slash.
Nimbly leaping aside, he made a motion that had something
debonair in its execution, and cut a ghastly big
flap, like a steak, from the monster’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow let out an awful bellow and ran at his
opponent, striking at him like a mad Hercules.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spare yourself, fool-killer,” said Adam. He dared
to bow, as he dodged a mighty onslaught, in which
Gallows used his sword like a hatchet, and then he
flicked the giant’s ear away, bodily, taking something
also of his jowl, for good measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great hulk stamped about there like an ox, the
blood hastening down from his face and being flung in
spatters about him. Adam next cut him deeply in the
muscle of his great left arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I warm to my work,” he said, as he darted actively
away and back. “Gentlemen, is your choice for
a wing or a leg of the ill-smelling bird?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dandy, fresh from England, guffawed and cried
“Bravo!” He had been born a gentleman, in spite of
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The fight was a travesty on equality. The monster
was absolutely helpless. He was simply a vast machine
for butchery, but he must needs first catch his victim
before he could perform his offices. He was a terrible
sight, with his great sword raised on high, or ripping
downward through the air, as he ran, half blinded by
his own gore, to catch the rover, who played with him,
slicing him handily, determined not to kill the beast
and so to incur a penalty for murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The creatures inside the tavern, appalled by the exhibition
they had brought about, saw that their monster
was soon to be a staggering tower of blood and wounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t let him get away! Kill him! Kill him!”
said the voice of Randolph, from behind the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam heard him. He saw Pinchbecker shrink back
at once. Psalms Higgler, however, glad of an excuse
and ready to take advantage of a man already sufficiently
beset, came scrambling out. The foppish gentleman
was too much of a sport to take a hand against
such a single swordsman as he found in Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aware that he was to have no chance, and convinced
abruptly that these wretches had plotted to kill him,
Adam deftly avoided Gallows, as the dreadful brute
came again upon him, and slashing the fellow’s leg
behind the knee, ham-strung him instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roaring like a wounded bull, the creature dropped
down on his side, and then got upon his hands and
knees and commenced to crawl, wiping out his eyes
with his reddened hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unable to restrain his rage, and fearing his intended
victim would yet avoid him, Higgler being already at
bay and disarmed, Randolph came abruptly out from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the tavern himself, pistol in hand, to perform the task
which otherwise was doomed to failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Call the guard!” he cried. “Call the guard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had been waiting for some such treachery. He
cut at the pistol the second it rose, knocking it endways
and slicing Randolph’s arm, superficially, from
near the wrist to the elbow. He waited then for nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Across the road, before any one guessed his intention,
he was up on the back of the horse, before the yelled
protest of the English gentleman came to his ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen all,” he called to the group, “good
evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Clapping his heels to the ribs of the restive animal,
he rode madly away, just as Isaiah Pinchbecker, with
half a dozen constables came running frantically upon
the scene.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A REFUGEE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Irresponsibly</span> joyous, thus to be in a saddle, on a
spirited horse, Rust was soon dashing across the common
and turning about like a centaur, for ease and
grace, glanced back to see who might be joining in the
race. His naked sword was still in his hand. It was
red from point to hilt. He wiped it on the horse,
thereby causing the animal to plunge and to run in a
frenzy of nervousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam chortled. The affair from beginning to end,
from his present standpoint, appealed to his sense of
humor. The consequences of his adventure would be
presented to his mind soon enough. He merely knew
now that he had won out of a tight corner, as a gentleman
should, that a glorious animal was bounding beneath
him and, that sweet night air came rushing upon
him as if it opened its arms to receive him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aware that he would soon be pursued, and mentally
acknowledging that the horse was not his own, he rode
to a farm-house about a mile or so out from the town,
and there dismounted. Reluctantly he said farewell to
the charger, bidding the farmer have the animal returned
to Boston in the morning, with his thanks and
compliments. For the service he presented the wondering
man with a piece of silver, the last he had of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>small amount left him after paying the fares of the
beef-eaters up to Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coolly inviting himself to have a bite of the farmer’s
scanty supper, he bade the man good night, about five
minutes before the mounted constables came riding
hotly to the place. He even heard them, when they
left the farm and began to scour the woods to jump
him up. At this he smiled with rare good humor, confident
of the powers of superior wood-craft to baffle
anybody or anything in all Massachusetts, save alone
an Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Understanding all the delighted chucklings of the
forest as he did, he felt at once secure among the trees,
as one of the family. Moreover he loved to be wandering
in the woods at night. He continued to walk, on
and on, beginning to wonder at last what he really intended
to do. Then, at the thought of Garde, who
might be expecting to see him, and whom he very much
desired again to see, he waxed somewhat impatient with
this enforced flight from the town where she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more he thought upon it, then, the more impossible
it seemed for him to return. Against Randolph,
enthroned in power, and against all his wretched
disciples, he could not expect to breathe a word which
would avail to get him justice. It would be sheer
madness to make the attempt. The creatures would
charge him with all the crimes on the calendar, and,
swearing all to one statement, would convict him of
anything they chose. The whole affair had been
planned to beat him, or worse, and to a galling extent
it had quite succeeded. He was balked, completely
and absolutely, in whatsoever direction his meditations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>turned. To try to see Garde would be fairly suicidal.
Not to see her, especially after his promises, would be,
to a man so much in love as he, a living death.</p>

<p class='c007'>And again, the beef-eaters. What was to become of
his faithful retinue? They would arrive there, only
to find that he had again deserted them, leaving them
wholly at the mercy of Randolph and his jackals. These
demons would not be slow at recognizing who and
what Pike and Halberd were, from episodes of the past.
The two would go straight into the lion’s mouth, at
the Crow and Arrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought at first of going to Plymouth. He could
write to Garde from there, he reflected, and also to
Halberd and Pike. But he soon concluded that this
would be to walk merely into the other end of the
enemy’s trap, for no good or comforting purpose.
New York presented itself as a jurisdiction where Randolph’s
arm would have no power to do him harm.
But New York was a long way off. If he went there,
not only would he miss seeing Garde, but he could not
warn his retinue in time to keep them out of Randolph’s
clutches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The business was maddening. He began to think,
as a consequence of dwelling on the hopelessness of his
own situation, that Randolph would be aiming next at
Garde herself, in wreaking his dastardly vengeance for
his past defeats. This was intolerable. He halted,
there in the dark woods, swaying between the good
sense of hiding and the nonsense of going straight back
to the town, to carry Garde away from the harpies,
bodily.</p>

<p class='c007'>A picture of old David Donner, stricken, helpless, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>child, arose in his mind, to confront him and to mock
his Quixotic scheme. He could not carry both Garde
and her grandfather away to New York, nor even to
the woods. He was penniless. This was not the only
obstacle, even supposing Donner would consent so to
flee, which was not at all likely.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also certain that Garde would not permit him
to carry her off and leave the old man behind. But at
least, he finally thought, he could go back to the town
and be near, to protect her, if occasion should require
a sword and a ready wit. Could he but manage to do
this—to go there secretly and remain there unknown—he
could gather his beef-eaters about him and together
they could and would combat an army!</p>

<p class='c007'>But how to go back and be undetected, that was the
question. In the first place he despised the idea of
doing anything that did not smack of absolute boldness
and fearlessness. Yet Boston was a seething
whirlpool of Randolph’s power, at this time. Simply
to be caught like a rat and killed like a pest would add
nothing of glory to his name, nor could it materially
add to Garde’s happiness and safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Driven into a corner of his brain, as it were, by all
these moves and counter-moves on the chess-board of
the situation, he presently conceived a plan which
made him hug himself in sheer delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would simply disguise himself as an Indian and
go to town to make a treaty with Randolph, the Big-man-afraid-to-be-chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>This so tickled his fancy that, had an Indian settlement
been near at hand, he would have been inside his
buckskins and war-paint and back to Boston ahead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the constables themselves. In such a guise, he told
himself, he could manage to see his sweetheart, he
could get his beef-eaters clear of danger, baffle his foes,
and arrange to carry both Garde and her grandfather
away to safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the first consideration was, where should he find
an Indian? He was aware that the Red men had been
pushed backward and westward miles from the towns
of the whites. It was years since he had roamed
through the forests and mountains——years since he had
known where his old-time, red brothers built their
lodges. There could be but one means of finding a
camp, namely: to walk onward, to penetrate fairly to
the edge of the wilderness beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing daunted by the thought of distance, he
struck out for the west. Like the Indians themselves,
he could smell the points of the sunrise and sunset,
unerringly. With boyish joy in his thoughts, and in
the dreams he fashioned of the hair-breadth events
that would happen when he arrived in the town in his
toggery, he plodded along all night, happy once more
and contented.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A FOSTER PARENT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam</span> covered many a mile before the morning.
Mindless of his hunger, spurred by the thought that
he must soon be back in Boston, he felt that the further
he went the more he must hasten. Thus he
marched straight on till noon.</p>

<p class='c007'>He rested briefly at this time, filled his craving
stomach with water, and again made a start. In fifteen
minutes he came upon a clearing, at the edge of a little
valley where up-jutting rocks were as plentiful as
houses in a city. Pausing for a moment, to ascertain
the nature of the place, and to prepare himself against
possible surprise, he presently approached a small log
hut, of more than usually rude construction.</p>

<p class='c007'>There appeared to be no signs whatsoever of life
about the place. No smoke ascended from the
chimney; there was no animal in sight, not even so
much as a dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam glanced hurriedly about the acre or so of land,
beholding evidences of recent work. A tree had been
felled, not far away, within the week. In a neat little
patch of tilled soil, green corn stood two feet high and
growing promisingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Going to the cabin-door he knocked first and gave it
a push afterward, for it was not latched, although it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>was nearly closed. There being no response from the
inside, he entered. The light entered with him. It
revealed a strange and dreadful scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the floor lay a man, dressed, half raised on his
elbow, looking up at the visitor with staring eyes, while
he moved his lips without making a sound. A few
feet away sat a little brown baby-boy, clothed only in
a tiny shirt. He looked up at big Adam wistfully.
Strewn about were a few utensils for cooking, a bag
which had once contained flour, the dust of which was
in patches everywhere, and an empty water-bucket and
dipper, with all the bedding and blankets from a rude
wooden bunk, built against the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>In amazement Adam stood looking at the man. In
the haggard face, with its unkempt beard and glassy
eyes he fancied he saw something familiar. Memory
knocked to enter his brain. Then, with a suddenness
that gave him a shock, he recognized a man he had
known in England—an elder brother of Henry Wainsworth,
supposed to have died years before—drowned
while attempting to escape from an unjust sentence
of imprisonment for treason.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wainsworth!” he said, “good faith! what is the
meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man sank back on the floor, a ghost of a smile
passing across his face. He moved his lips again, but
Adam heard not a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bending quickly down, he became aware that the
man was begging for water. He caught up the bucket
and hastened forth, presently finding the spring, to
which a little path had been worn in the grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Back at once, he placed the dipper to the dried-out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>lips and saw this fellow-being drink with an evidence
of joy such as can only come to the dying. Wainsworth
shivered a little, as the dipper left his teeth, and jerked
his hand toward the silent child, sitting so near, on the
floor. Adam comprehended. He gave more of the
water to the small, brown baby. It patted the dipper
with its tiny hands and looked up at him dumbly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in the world has happened here?” said
Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making a mighty effort, the man on the floor partially
raised his head and arms. He looked at Adam with a
hungering light in his eyes. “I’m—done—for,” he
said, thickly and feebly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam hustled together the blankets on the floor and
made a pillow, which he placed for Wainsworth to lie
on. “Shall I put you into the bed?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man shook his head. “I’m crushed,” he said,
winking from his eyes the already gathering film that
tells of the coming end. “Tree—fell—killed the—wife.
I—crawled—here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked at him helplessly. He knew the man
was dying. He felt what agonies the man must have
suffered. “Man!” he said, “can’t I get you something
to eat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wainsworth waved his hand toward the wreckage
strewed on the floor. “Nothing—here,” he said.
Then he made a great effort, the obvious rally of his
strength. “Save the—boy,” he implored. “Give him
a—chance.... Don’t—tell—about me. I married—his
mother—Narragansett—God bless—her.... Give—him—a—chance....
Thanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he mentioned the child’s mother, his eyes gave up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>two tears—crystals, which might have represented his
soul, for it had quietly escaped from his broken body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam, kneeling above him, looked for a moment at
his still face, on which the shadow of a smile rested.
Then he looked at the little, brown youngster, half
Narragansett Indian, gazing up in his countenance with
a timid, questioning look, winking his big black eyes
slowly, and quite as deliberately moving his tiny toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not a situation to be thought out nor coped
with easily. To have found any human being in this
terrible plight would have been enough, but to have
found Henry Wainsworth’s brother thus, and to have
him tell such a brief, shocking story, and make of his
visitor all the things which Adam would have to become
at once, was enough to make him stand there wondering
and wondering upon it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You poor little rascal,” he said to the child, at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>He selected a shovel and a pick, from some tools
which he noted, in a corner, and laying aside his sword,
he went to work, on the preface to his duties, out by
the patch of corn where he found the pretty, young
Indian mother, clasped and held down to earth in an
all too ardent embrace, by an arm of the fallen tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had padded up the mound over the two
closed human volumes, he was faint with hunger. He
carried the tools again to the house, and stood as before,
looking at the baby-boy, who still sat where he had left
him, on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I suppose you are hungry, you little brown
man,” he said. “I must see what there is to be had.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was little opportunity for extended explorations.
The one room had contained the all of Wainsworth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>his Narragansett partner. Rust soon found himself
wondering what the two had lived upon. What flour
and meal there had been, the man, despite his two
crushed legs, had pulled down, from a box-like cupboard,
on the wall, together with a bit of dried meat. Of the
latter only a dry fragment remained, still tied to a
string, while of the meal and flour, only the empty bags
gave evidence that they once had existed.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no way possible for Adam to know that in
the forest, not far away, the lone woodsman had set his
traps, for squirrels and rabbits, nor that fifteen minutes’
walk from the door a trout stream had furnished its
quota to the daily fare. He only knew that there was
nothing edible to be found here now. There was salt,
a bit of grease, on a clean white chip of pine, and a half
gourd, filled with broken-up leaves, which had doubtless
been steeped for some manner of tea or drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partner,” he said, to the child, “someone has
been enforcing sumptuary laws upon us. I hesitate in
deciding whether we shall take our water salted or
fresh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his hand on the hilt of his sword he regarded
the youngster earnestly. Nothing prettier than the
little naked fellow could have been imagined, howbeit
he was not so plump as a child of his age should be, for
the lack of nourishment had already told upon him
markedly. Adam felt convinced, from various indications,
that the tree which had done its deadly work
had fallen about a week before, and that Wainsworth
had not been able to do anything more than to crawl to
the cabin, to die, neither for himself or the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a time the rover wondered what he must do.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>His own plans had nearly disappeared from his mind.
He reflected that a child so brown as this, so obviously
half a little Narragansett, would be ill received by the
whites. The Indians would be far more likely to
cherish the small man, according to his worth. He
therefore believed the best thing he could do would be
to push onward, in the hope of finding an Indian settlement
soon. There were several reasons, still remaining
unaltered, why it would be wiser not to take the
child to Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, our faces are dirty, partner,” he said, at the
end of a long cogitation, in which the baby had never
ceased to look up in his countenance and wink his big
eyes, wistfully.  “Let’s go out and have a bath.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took the tiny chap up in his arms and carried him
forth to the spring. Here, in the warm sunlight, he
got down on his knees in the grass, bathed his protégé,
over and over again, for the pleasure it seemed to
give the child and the joy it was to himself, to feel the
little wet, naked fellow in his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun performed the offices of a towel. Without
putting his tiny shirt back upon him, Adam rolled the
small bronze bit of humanity about his back, patting
his velvety arms and thighs and laughing like the
grown-up boy he was, till the little chap gurgled and
crowed in tremendous delight. But it having been
only the freshness of the water, air and sunlight which
had somewhat invigorated the baby, he presently appeared
to grow a little dull and weary. Adam became
aware that it was time to be moving. He washed out
the child’s wee shirt and hung it through his belt to
dry as they went. Then taking a light blanket from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the cabin, for the child’s use at night, he left the cabin
behind and proceeded onward as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked till late in the afternoon without discovering
so much as a sign of the Indian settlement he was
seeking. By this time his own pangs of hunger had
become excruciating. It was still too early in the
summer for berries or nuts to be ripe, and the half
green things which he found where the sun shone the
warmest were in no manner fit to be offered to the child,
as food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arriving at another small valley, as the sun was dipping
into the western tree-tops, the rover sat down for
a rest, and to plan something better than this random
wandering toward the sunset. He had chuckled encouragement
to the child from time to time, laughing
in the little fellow’s face, but hardly had he caught at
the subtle signs on the small face, at which a mother-parent
would have stared wild-eyed in agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, however, as he sat the tiny man on the grass
before him, he saw in the baby’s eyes such a look as
pierced him to the quick. For a moment the infinite
wistfulness, the dumb questioning, the uncomplaining
silence of it, made him think, or hope, the child was
only sad. He got down on all fours at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partner,” said he, jovially, “you are disappointed
in me. I make poor shift as a mother. Do you want
to be cuddled, or would you rather be tickled?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He laid the little chap gently on his back and tried
to repeat the frolic of the earlier hours. He rolled the
small bronze body in the grass, as before, and petted
him fondly. But the baby merely winked his eyes.
He seemed about to cry, but he made no sound.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Adam’s fingers ceased their play, for the joy departed
from them swiftly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you’re tired and sleepy,” he crooned.
“Shall I put on your shirt and sing you a little Indian
lullaby? Yes? That’s what he wants, little tired
scamp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He adjusted the abbreviated shirt, awkwardly, but
tenderly, after which he held his partner in his arms
and hummed and sang the words of a Wampanoag
song, which he had heard in his boyhood, times without
number. The song started with addresses to some
of the elements, thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Brook, it is night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be quiet, and let my baby sleep.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little wind, it is night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go away, and let my baby sleep.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little storm, it is night,</div>

      <div class='line'>“Little wolf, it is night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Howl not, and let my baby sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>and after many verses monotonously soothing, came an
incantation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great Spirit, I place my babe</div>

      <div class='line'>As I cannot protect;</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore, oh Great Spirit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Guard my child in slumber.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Adam sang this song like a pleading. But his little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>partner could not sleep, or feared to sleep. Then the
rover looked at the tiny face and realized that the child
would soon be dying of starvation. At this he started
to his feet, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had undergone the pains of hunger often, himself;
he was not impatient now with the pangs in his
stomach, nor the weakness in his muscles. But he
could not bear the thought of the child so perishing,
here in the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw poor Wainsworth again, and heard him beg
that the child be given a chance. He thought of the
man’s shattered life, his escape from persecution, his
isolation, in which he had preferred the society of his
Indian wife and child to association with his kind.
Then he blamed himself for coming further into this
deserted region, when he knew that by going back, at
least he could find something for the child to eat—something
that would save its life!</p>

<p class='c007'>But he could not forget that he himself was a refugee.
Wrongly or rightly, Randolph was still on his
track. Nothing in his own case had been altered, but
the case was no longer one concerning himself alone.
He took the child on his arm, where he had carried
him already many miles, and faced about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partner, let them take me,” he said. “I wish
them joy of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He started back for Boston, for in the child’s present
extremity, the nearest place where he could be sure of
finding food was the only one worthy a thought.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>REPUDIATED SILVER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Sometime</span>, along toward the middle of the night,
Adam tripped, on a root which lay in his path, and in
catching himself so that his small partner should not
be injured, he sprained his foot. He proceeded onward
without sparing the member, however, for he had begun
to feel a fever of impatience.</p>

<p class='c007'>His foot swelled. It finally pained him excessively,
so that he limped. He wore away the night, but when
the morning came, he was obliged to snatch an hour of
sleep, so great was the sense of exhaustion come upon
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face had become pale. With his hair unkempt,
his eyes expressive of the fever in his veins and his
mouth somewhat drawn, he was not a little haggard, as
he resumed his lame, onward march. The child in his
arms was no burden to his enduring strength, but as a
load on his heart the little chap was heavy indeed.
Sleeping, the miniature man appeared to be sinking in
a final rest, so wan had his tiny face become. Waking,
he gazed at Adam with such a dumb inquiry ever
present in his great, wistful eyes, that Rust began to
wish he would complain—would cry, would make some
little sound to break his baby silence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>They were obliged to rest frequently, throughout the
day. Try as he might, Adam could not cover the
ground rapidly. Whenever he resumed walking, after
sitting for a moment on a log, or a rock, he found his
foot had become so bad that, in the late afternoon, he
gave up halting thus altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>The twilight came upon him, then the night-fall.
At last, with a smothered cry of delight on his lips, he
saw the gleam of a light. He had come to the farm-house
where he had stopped to return the English
dandy’s horse and to eat his last supper. Thinking
thereby to disguise himself, even if only slightly, he
halted, threw off his leather jerkin, sword and coat,
turned the latter inside out and concealed his weapon
and outside garment in the brush. Thus altered in
appearance, he dragged his aching foot across the space
between the woods and the house, where he knocked
upon the door and entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s there?” cried the farmer, in a fright which
recent events had instilled in his being. He was a
shaking old bachelor, suspected by many who knew
him of being a miser with a great horde of gold on his
premises.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was confronted by the man, as soon as he
stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Food, man,” he said, hoarsely. “Food, or this
child will die!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man recognized him instantly. He fairly
quaked with dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go out! Go out!” he cried. “I’ve no food
here—I’ve nothing here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Peace!” commanded Adam. “Bring me forth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>something to eat for the child, you knave, or I shall
find it for myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked terrible enough to execute a much more
dreadful threat. The farmer retreated before him,
cringing and whining.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing, or you should have it,” he said,
with a whimper. “My neighbors—ten minutes’ walk
up the clearing—go to them. They have plenty, and
I have nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam remembered the scantiness of the fare he had
tasted here before. Nevertheless it had been food, and
anything now might save his little partner’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you go, friend,” he ordered. “Make
haste and bring me what you can, from your neighbors’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man seemed about to refuse. He changed his
mind abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go. I’ll go!” he hastened to say, and without
his hat, or waiting for anything further, he hobbled
out at the door and was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust lost no time in ransacking the cupboard. To
his unspeakable disappointment he found that the man
had not spoken wide of the truth. There was as little
here, in the way of a few gnawed crusts of bread and a
rind of cheese, as might well stand between nothing
and something to eat and to feed to a starving child.
His heart sank within him. But then he thought that
inasmuch as the farmer had told the truth about his
larder, he would be the more likely to have spoken
correctly about the neighbors. He would soon be back
with something fit for the wee Narragansett.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked at the baby-boy compassionately. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>little fellow was awake, looking up, winking slowly,
asking his dumb, wistful question with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam patted him softly while he waited. “I’m a
wretched mother, little partner,” he said. “But we’ll
soon have you banqueting, now. Can’t you speak up a
little bit? Don’t you want to give old Adam just one
little smile? No? Well, never mind. Little man is
tired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had placed his charge in a chair. Soon growing
impatient, he limped about the room, crunching a crust
of bread in his teeth, abstractedly. Unable to endure
the suspense, he went again to the cupboard and threw
everything down, in his search for something fit for the
child. There was nothing more than he had seen before.
He went to the water pail and drank, for his
mouth had found the crust a poor substitute for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet no sooner had he sipped the water than a sense
of the deliciousness of the dry bread pervaded his being.
He ran to gather up the other crusts at once and
limped to the child in a frenzy of gladness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, little man,” he said, kneeling down on the
floor. “If you can only chew that up and then take a
sip of water, you will think the King’s kitchen has
opened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He gently thrust a small piece of the rock-hard bread
between the little chap’s lips, where, to his intense disappointment,
it remained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t you chew it?” he said. “Just try, for old
Adam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The child was too weak to do anything but wink.
Its appealing gaze was more than Adam could stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can Adam do for the little man?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>He limped painfully back and forth again. The
farmer should have returned before this. What could
be keeping the wretch? The rover saw that the little
life was fluttering, uncertainly, not yet sure of its wings
on which to fly away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have it!” he cried, in sudden exultation.
“Bread and water!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hobbled across the room, snatched up a cup,
crunched a fistful of crusts in his hand, put them in his
cup and filled it half to the top with water. Then
he stirred the hard pieces with his finger and crushed
them smaller and padded them up against the side of
the vessel, working the mass softer in feverish haste.
Impatient to get results, he put the cup to the baby’s
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drink,” he coaxed. “Take a little, like a good
partner. Can’t you take a little weeny bit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Groaning, thus to find the small Narragansett so
weak, he hobbled about to find a spoon, with which he
came hastily limping back. To his joy then, he saw a
little of the slightly nutritious water disappear between
the silent lips. He crooned with delight, hitched himself
closer and plied his spoon clumsily, but with all the
patience of a woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The child began to take the nourishment with interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was happy in the midst of this new-found
expedient, when the door behind him was suddenly
thrown open, violently, and in burst half a dozen
constables, armed to the teeth and panting wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give up! I arrest you in the name of the King!”
cried the foremost of the men. He presented a pistol
at the head of the kneeling man. “Take him!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>screamed to his following, and before Rust could so
much as rise, on his wounded foot, he was suddenly
struggling in a mass of men who had fallen upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He got to his feet. He knocked three of the constables
endways. But his strength was gone quickly,
so long had he been famished, and so far had he taxed
his endurance. They overpowered him, making a noise
of mad confusion. They threw him toward a chair.
He made one cry of anguish and protest. Three of the
scrambling clods fell together upon the little partner,
and when they arose, his little heart had ceased to beat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer-miser now came worming his way through
the door. He was laughing like a wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got him!” he cried. “I told you! I told
you! Heh, heh, heh. I’m not in league with thieves
and murderers. Here, here, take your silver! I’ll
none of your silver!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took from his pocket the coin which the rover had
paid him to take back the Englishman’s horse and
threw it hysterically down at Adam’s feet.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LODGINGS FOR THE RETINUE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> beef-eaters arrived in the afternoon of the same
day that Adam was arrested. Alighting from the coach,
they did exactly what he had feared they would. They
wended their way promptly to the Crow and Arrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph and his henchmen, having missed their
intended prey, at their first attempt, were engaged
elsewhere in the town, attempting to make good their
failure. Believing Rust would return and attempt to
see Mistress Merrill, Randolph kept one or two of his
creatures in the vicinity of David Donner’s house day
and night. But Gallows, being for the time totally disabled,
had been domiciled at the tavern, in a small
apartment off the tap-room, where he spent many hours
of the day roaring out his exceeding displeasure at the
turn of events and the consequences thereof, into which
his friends had brought him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pike and Halberd appeared at the inn when the place
was all but deserted. Naturally the tavern had become
popular with the Royalists, but it had been gradually
falling into disfavor with sailors and dock hands for
several years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Striding haughtily into the place, the beef-eaters
accosted the landlord familiarly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“My good fellow,” said little Pike, “be kind enough
to let the Sachem know that we have arrived and wait
upon his pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And assure him of the excellence of our health,”
said Halberd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what you mean,” said the landlord,
eying the pair suspiciously and cudgeling his brains to
remember where and when he had seen them before.
“I have no Mr. Sachem in the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has no Mr. Sachem in the house,” said the
beef-eaters, in chorus, turning to one another with
raised eyebrows and indulgent smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This surpasses belief,” said Halberd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My good friend, you mistook what we said,” added
Pike. “We are inquiring for The Sachem—not Mr.
Sachem, but The Sachem.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know the Sachem,” said the landlord,
frowning upon the guests. “What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He don’t know the Sachem!” said the comrades,
again in chorus. They looked perfectly incredulous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I pity you for your loss,” Pike remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if he is not at this house, where is he?” asked
Halberd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us where to find him and we will burden you
with wealth,” Pike added, grandly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The landlord began to be certain they were crazy.
“How should I know who it is you seek?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Water! fetch me water!” roared Gallows, from
the adjoining room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What disturbance is this?” Halberd wanted to
know. He strode to the door and looked in at the mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of meat, propped up in bed, poulticed and patched
past all semblance to himself. “Friend,” Halberd said
to him, boldly, “your voice needs bleeding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” bellowed Gallows, “you be a fool and I be
the fool-killer! Let me get——Howtch!” He made
this latter exclamation on attempting to rise from his
lair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Halberd and Pike both fell to the rear a step, at the
awful voice of the brute, but no sooner did they see him
sink helplessly down on the couch than they laughed
in eloquent scorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should enjoy nothing better than to slay something
large, before dinner,” little Pike remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tut. This is my recreation,” said Halberd.
“Come forth, friend, till I warm some cold steel in
your belly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave be!” commanded the landlord, coming forward
to shut the door between the rooms, and flapping
his apron at the belligerent beef-eaters. “Let me
know your wants, if you have them, and if not, be off
about your business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sensibly spoken,” said Halberd. “All we desire of
you is that you let the Sachem know we are come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I said I didn’t know this Sachem!” cried the
exasperated boniface.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True, true,” said Pike. “But it seems too monstrous
to be so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” put in Halberd, “you must remember that
wealthy young nobleman, who paved our way with
gold, when we were with you a number of years ago.
Surely you cannot yet have spent what we scattered in
your house?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“And you will certainly remember the drubbing we
gave those varlets, with the flat of our swords, here in
this very room—some dozen of the fellows there were
in all,” added the other of the pair. “They dared to
insinuate that we were beggars—aye, beggars, forsooth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The landlord remembered them now, clearly enough.
He restrained himself from calling them vile names,
by making an effort truly heroic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, to be sure, I do recall it now,” he said, cunningly.
“I believe your Sachem did even call here, to
ask if you had come. Yes, yes. I think he said he
meant to return here this afternoon again. Was he not
a tall, noble-looking gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like a king,” said Pike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With a manner like this,” added Halberd, strutting
and swaggering across the room. “He should have
walked in over several prostrate forms, in the manner
of a prince and our associate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same, the very same,” agreed the landlord.
“He is certain to be here within the hour. Sit down,
gentlemen, and let me serve you, and then I shall be
honored to have a look about, myself, to see if I may
not find him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Said like a scholar,” Halberd assured him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do this honor to your house for his sake,” Pike
added.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two sat them down and the landlord hustled
them out the vilest drink he could draw, tampered
with, as it was, to add some crude substance, the effect
of which on the brain was overpowering. The fellow
saw the beef-eaters drinking and waited for nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>more. He scampered away from the rear of his place,
as fast as his limbs could convey him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifteen minutes later a small army of constables
arrived, captured the two brain-fuddled beef-eaters
without the slightest resistance and carried them off to
the sumptuous apartments of the city jail. There, with
aching heads and crestfallen countenances, they discovered
themselves to be, when the baleful effects of
their drink had somewhat abated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my fighting hand!” said Halberd, “I’d not be
sworn that we have not been tricked.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GARDE OBTAINS THE JAIL KEYS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Unbeknown</span> to his retinue, Adam was accommodated
in the same jail where Pike and Halberd had been
landed while the evening was still comparatively young.
The body of the little Narragansett, brutally snatched
from Adam’s arms, had likewise been brought into
Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph had lost no time in having Rust examined
and declared a prisoner of the state, charged with a
whole category of crimes against the peace and dignity
of the King. To all of this, and to nearly all of their
questions, Rust had made no reply whatsoever. He
realized the uselessness of pitting his one voice against
those of half a dozen perjured rascals, who came about
him the moment it was known he had finally been
taken, ready to swear to anything which would be
likeliest to jeopardize his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, before half-past eight that night, the whole of
Boston was wagging its tongue over an astonishing
story, instigated at once by Edward Randolph. This
dangerous, blood-thirsty rascal, Rust, had been taken
in the forest, whither he had fled to join his Indian
wife, and in his struggles to avoid arrest he had slain
his half-Indian child.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the indictment, mildly expressed, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>reached the ears of Garde Merrill concerning her lover.
She was simply appalled. It was unbelievable, it was
monstrous. She scorned to think it could possibly be
true. And yet, if he had been in Boston several days
before, as the story had it, why had she known nothing
about it? The whole thing had been a gross fabrication.
He could not have been in the town and going to
a tavern to mix in a horrid brawl. He would certainly
have come to see her immediately on his arrival. He
had promised to return in about a week from a visit to
the beef-eaters.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she got as far as that, she suddenly tried to
stop thinking. He had been gone many weeks instead
of the one; the beef-eaters had not been with him
when he had the alleged fight, nor when he was captured,
and he had mentioned to her, on their walk
from Plymouth, that he had once stopped at the Crow
and Arrow, where the brawl was reported to have taken
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly frantic with the terrible thoughts in her
head, Garde hastened to John Soam’s to get what she
could of sober truth, which John would have as no one
else might in the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was mentally distraught when she came to her
uncle’s. She had carried a dish belonging to her aunt
Gertrude, to make an excuse for her late evening visit.
She was more glad than she could have said that Prudence
was away, for her cousin knew something of her
feeling for Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde, having been made welcome, had no need to
ask questions. John Soam was telling the story of the
night with countless repetitions. His wife cross-examined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>him in every direction which her womanly ingenuity
could suggest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Garde discovered that it was undeniably true
that Adam had been in town several days before; that
he had been engaged in a terrible fight, in which he
had inflicted grave injuries on Randolph and one of
his “peaceable officers”; that he had then escaped
back to the woods, from which, it was alleged, he had
emerged solely for this fighting, and that, when captured,
he had a half-Indian child in his possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Soam had seen the body of the child himself.
He had heard the examination, in his capacity of clerk
to the court and magistrates. Rust was lame, he said,
and he was a sullen man, who had returned no answers
but such as cut wittily. He had not denied that the
child was his own. He had absolutely refused to say
whose it was and how he came to have it. He had
come to the farmer’s house, at the edge of the woods,
for purposes of robbery. There was every reason to
believe that he had consorted with the Indians, and
that the child was his. It was a pretty child, but
many thought it looked as if it had been shockingly
abused. There could be no doubt that, when he had
found himself being taken, he had profited by the confusion
to slay the little half-Indian boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde’s horror grew as she listened. She remembered
terrible things that Adam had told her when he
believed her a youth. He had excused Randolph’s
conduct with Hester Hodder, hinting broadly that, in
a case he had in mind, he thought another young
woman—in this instance Garde herself—ought to forgive
such a treachery to honor. He had even mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>that she, when dressed as a boy and browned,
reminded him of a young Indian woman whom he had
known and liked. He had lived with the Indians as a
boy; he had gone back to them as a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>All those other dreadful half-confessions, in this new
light, looked no longer innocent—the French damsel,
the Countess, and the others. He had deceived her
about going to New York to see the beef-eaters, she
told herself, in agony. He had gone to the forest instead.
And God only knew what things he had done
in those silent woods! Had he abandoned the mother
of his child, as Randolph had done——or had he committed
something worse? for Hester, in the similar
instance, had died so strangely.</p>

<p class='c007'>At least it was plain that before Adam could marry
again he would be obliged to abandon that Indian
woman. And what if she were Indian? Was she less
a woman? Would she suffer less agony? Garde
thought of Hester, and of how the wild young thing
had begged her not to take away the man who had so
cruelly wronged her. The picture was almost more
than she could bear. The whole affair fell upon her
heart with a weight that crushed her happiness into a
shapeless, dying thing. In whatsoever direction she
turned, Adam’s own actions and words confronted her
with the blank wall of hideous truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew now why, after he had walked all the way
to Boston at her side, he had failed to appear at
Grandther Donner’s, for days and days. She saw it
all, plainly—horribly plainly. It was so absolutely unescapable.
And yet, he had seemed so honest; he had
spoken so of love; he had so convinced her heart and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>her soul of his purity, nobility and worth! She loved
him still. She could not avoid this. It had grown up
with her; it had become a part of her very being. She
would love him always, but—she could not become his
wife—not after this—never! The thought of such a
thing made her shiver. His perfidy was almost greater
than Randolph’s—as an Indian woman would have
been so much more innocent and trustful than even
Hester.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart cried. “Oh!” and yet again, “Oh!” in
its anguish. If he had only left some little loophole
for doubt—if he had only denied their accusations—if
only he had not said those terrible things to her, upon
the highway, perhaps——“No, no, no, no,” she cried,
in her soul; this was compromising with loathsome dishonor.
Far better it was that the awful truth was so
indisputably established! It left her no ground for
excusing his deeds, at the dictates of her unreasoning
love! Yet, oh, it had been so sweet to believe in him,
to love him without reserve, to trust her very soul in
his keeping! She wrung her hands under the table,
as she listened, with ears that seemed traitors to her
love, to all that her uncle could add to the story.</p>

<p class='c007'>She soon learned that Adam was Randolph’s particular
prisoner; that there had been some old-time
grudge between them, and that the crafty man of
power would undoubtedly make an effort to hang his
captive.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this her womanly inconsequence was suddenly
aroused. He might be guilty, but she had always
thought him noble and good. She would never marry
him, after this, but she would love him forever. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>had been her idol, her king. He must live, for at
least she had a right to keep enshrined in her heart the
thought of him, pulsating heart to heart with her, as
once he had. No! He must not be permitted to die—not
like this—not in infamy—not at the hands of
this monster of iniquity—this Randolph!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not that she had the slightest hope that he
could ever be the same to her again, or that she should
ever wish to see him again, but at least he had a right
to live, to redeem himself, partially, perhaps to suffer
and to sorrow for his deeds. Indeed he must so live—he
must so redeem himself for her sake—to justify the
love and the trust she had given him out of her heart!</p>

<p class='c007'>She felt that she should choke if she did not soon
get out in the air. She wanted to run to the prison,
hammer with her fist on the gate, demand admittance
and set him free—free from Randolph’s clutches. But
she knew this was madness. Her mouth grew parched
and dry with her excitement, so tremendously held in
control. How could she manage to get him free?
Oh, if only she dared to tell her uncle John and get
him to help her!</p>

<p class='c007'>He had the duplicate keys to every door in the jail.
He brought them home night after night and hung
them up on—There they were, now! They hung
there within reach of her hand! Her heart knocked
and beat in her bosom, as if it were hammering down
the barriers to Adam’s cell. She weaved dizzily, with
the possibilities of the moment. Just to take those
keys and run—that was all, and the trick would be
done. He could go—and their love would be a thing
of living death!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>She meant to take those keys. The impulse swayed
her whole being. She felt she would die rather than
miss her opportunity. With clenched hands and with
set jaws she arose to her feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must be going home,” she said, with apparent
calm. “Oh, what was that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was what?” said her aunt and uncle together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—some noise, in the other room,” she said
with a tremor easily simulated, in her excited state.
“I am sure I heard something in there, moving!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum—let’s see,” said John.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be that I left the window open,” said
Goodwife Soam.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man took the lamp, opened the door to the adjoining
apartment, and went in, followed by his wife.
Garde, with a gasp, and a clutching at her heart, lifted
the keys from their nail and dropped them into her
pocket with a barely audible jingle. She followed her
aunt a second later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it was—nothing, after all,” she said, weaving
a trifle in her stress of emotion and nervousness. “But
the window was up, as you said. I’m glad that was
all. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good night,” said John Soam and his wife, from
the window which John was pushing down, and without
waiting another minute, Garde let herself out and
sped away in the darkness.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GARDE’S ORDEAL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>How</span> to get the keys into Adam’s possession, now
that she had them in her own, was the first question
that presented itself to the mind of Garde. Her ruse
at her uncle’s had been so quickly and easily planned
and executed that she had almost fancied Adam freed
already. Yet as she hastened homeward, filled with
conflicting emotions of excitement, grief and despair,
she soon comprehended that her task had not as yet
really begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could she only ascertain in what portion of the
prison the rover was incarcerated, she thought it might
be possible to convey him the keys through the window,
provided he had one in his cell. Thinking of
this, she naturally remembered the jailer’s wife, a poor
ailing creature, who lived in the building, with her
husband, and to whom Goody Dune had ministered,
times without number, frequently sending Garde with
simples to relieve her of multitudinous aches and pains.
This was her cue. She could take her some of the
herbs of which a plentiful stock had been collected in
the Donner household, for the use of her grandfather.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately David Donner had so far progressed, if
not toward recovery, then at least toward change, that
he slept for hours, like a weary child, waking after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>dreamless slumber all pink and prattling. He was
thus asleep when she came to the house. She was
therefore soon on her way to the prison, her simples in
a small basket, hung on her arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hour was unusual for any one thus to be visiting
the jailer’s wife, so that the good woman, when Garde
came in, after knocking, was obviously surprised at the
honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mrs. Weaver,” said the girl, hurriedly, “I heard
you had been having trouble here to-day, and I knew
how it always upsets you, and Goody had given me all
these simples to bring, three days ago, so I thought I
had better bring them to you the moment I knew you
were being so worried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fact that the jailer’s wife was invariably
very much distressed when guests were thrust upon their
hospitality. She always feared at first that they would
get away, and afterward that they would not, as her abhorrence
and then her sympathy came respectively into
play. She also conjectured all manner of terrible
things that might at any moment happen to Blessedness
Weaver, her worthy husband. To-night she was
particularly nervous, owing to the sudden increase in
the jail’s population and the blood-freezing details and
rumors afloat as to the nature of the company
assembled under the roof of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, lassie,” she said, in answer to Garde’s
well-chosen speech, “do come in directly. I am that
fidgety and poorly, the night! Lauk, lassie, but you
are a dear, thoughtful heart, and I shall never forget
you for this. And we have such terrible gentlemen,
the night!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>She always called the guests gentlemen, till she
found out which way lay the sympathies of a given
visitor, when they all became rogues, forthwith, if she
found herself encouraged to this violent language.
Later on, again, when her sympathies for their plight
were aroused, they were restored to their former social
appellations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am so sorry for you!” said Garde. “I had
heard of one prisoner; but could you have had more
than one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lauk, yes,” said the woman rolling her eyes
heavenward. “They took the principal rogue in the
woods, I believe, but they captured his two brutal companions
at the Crow and Arrow in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was news to Garde. She recognized the beef-eaters
from this vivid description. If Adam had his
friends at his side, he must be much more contented,
and they would all be planning to escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so all three are under lock and key, safely together?”
she said, innocently. “How fortunate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear me, no,” corrected Mrs. Weaver. “The
two taken by daylight are together in the southern
exposure, while the last one was thrust in the
dungeon. Oh Lauk, Mistress, but he is a terrible
man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde felt her heart sink, even though it never ceased
for a moment to beat so hard that it pained her. Adam
in a dungeon! How in the world could she ever manage
to get the keys to him now? Dungeons, she knew,
were under the ground; they were dank, death-dealing
places, with moldy straw in one corner and with slimy
rocks for walls. She could have cried in her sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>wretchedness of spirit, although it could never mean
anything to her, whether Adam lived or died, in
prison or out. However, she mastered herself splendidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A dungeon?” she said. “Oh, I didn’t know you
had a dungeon here. It must be very deep down in the
earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a creepy place; oh lauk, it’s that creepy!”
said the woman. “But it’s not so deep, dearie. It’s
nine steps down. I’ve counted the steps many’s the
time. But it is where we puts the monstrously wicked
rogues, such as this bloodthirsty man! And it’s that
dark, my dear—oh lauk, what a place to spend the
night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it must be dark,” said Garde, suppressing
her eagerness. “They couldn’t have a window in such
a place as that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed we have, though; we’ve a window in every
room in the place,” corrected the jailer’s wife, with
commendable pride in the architectural arrangements.
“Oh yes, it has its window, no bigger than my hand,
lassie, and slanting up through the rock, but it’s a rare
little light it lets in to the poor gentlemen down
below!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad he—the prisoners here have some light,”
said Garde, honestly, “but I don’t see where such a
window could be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s on the dark side of the house, night and day
the same,” explained Mrs. Weaver. “It’s around on
the dark side, where no one would find it in a month of
Sundays, just about the length of my foot above the
ground. Such a small thing it is, and the light it lets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>in is that little! Oh lauk, I’m feeling worse to be
thinking upon it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you mustn’t talk about it any more,” Garde
assured her, sympathetically. “And I must be going
home. I do hope the simples will make you better, and
I’m so glad I came. I must say good night, for I suppose
you will all be going to bed very soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be there directly,” Mrs. Weaver informed
her, “but dear me, Blessedness won’t be touching a
pillow for an hour, and then he’ll sleep with his stockings
on. He always does the first night with new
rogues in the house. Good night, dearie, and God bless
you for a sweet child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde went out and walked slowly toward Grandther
Donner’s. She had an hour to wear away, for
she would not dare to be searching about the jail before
the jailer at least retired to his couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time was one of dread and chills. Her teeth
chattered, not from any suggestion of cold in the night
air, but from the nervous strain of this time of suspense.
She had never been so frightened of any action in her
life, as she was when at length she crept back to the
prison, through the dark, deserted streets, and began
to search about to find the tiny window of which Mrs.
Weaver had spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two dark sides to the building. One was
constantly in the shadow of a tavern, which almost
abutted against it, while the other was on the northern
face of the building, in a narrow street. Garde went
first to the northern exposure, for in order to get at the
other shaded side, she would have been obliged to climb
a low, brick wall.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Scarcely had she more than come to her destination,
and begun her feverish search, before she heard the
sound of distant footsteps, which rapidly approached.
She crouched in a black little niche, in fear, with a
violent commotion in her breast which threatened to
drop her down in a swoon. Almost stepping on her
toes, some pedestrian passed, leaving the girl so horribly
weak that she shut her eyes and leaned against the wall,
laboring to get her breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nerved again by the things Mrs. Weaver had told
her, she came out of her hiding-place, after several
minutes, and feeling the cold rock-wall she passed
eagerly along, shaking with her chill and fearing to
breathe too loud, in the silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was doomed here to bitter disappointment. The
window was not to be found. She searched again and
again, unwilling to give it up, but it was not there.
She realized that she must climb the brick barrier, and
try on the other side of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>She found the wall not difficult to surmount, but
when she jumped down, on the further side, she
struck on a heap of broken crockery, thrown out from
the tavern.</p>

<p class='c007'>She crouched down instantly, for the noise she had
made attracted the notice of some one in the public
house. A door at the rear of the hostelry was thrown
open and a man looked out. He appeared to be looking
straight at her and listening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Must have been a cat,” he said, to somebody back
in the house, and he disappeared and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde could not have been any more wrought upon
than the whole affair had made her already. She could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>not become calm. She could merely wait for moments
of partial relief from overwhelming emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in time she was creeping along again, feeling
the dark stone as before and peering vainly and desperately
into the shadows which lay so densely upon the
whole enclosure. Hastily she traversed the whole
length of the wall. She arrived at the far end, ready
to sink down and cry in anguish. She had not discovered
the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Back again she went, choking back hysterical sobs
and bruising her delicate hands on the rough rocks, as
she played with her fingers along that grim, dark pile.
She failed again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sitting where she was, in the grass, which was growing
rank in the place, she clasped her hands in despair.
She would have to give it up. There was some mistake.
There was no window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet once more she would try. She could not give it
up. The dungeon’s horrors and the terrible character
of Edward Randolph made her fear that if the morning
came before Adam was free, he would no longer
have need for freedom, nor light.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slowly, this time, and digging at the base of the
stone-wall that rose above her, she felt down to the very
roots of the grass, for the aperture which represented a
window. To her unspeakable joy, her fingers suddenly
ran into an absolute hole in the solid rock, in a matted
growth of roots and grass, which had grown up about it!</p>

<p class='c007'>She sank down, momentarily overcome with this discovery.
It was too much to believe. She felt she was
almost dying, so insupportable was the agitation of her
heart. But she presently clutched at the grass and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>tore it away in a mad fever of haste. She dug, with
her fingers and her finger nails. She could smell the
odor of the bruised grass, and then the wholesome
fragrance of earth. She had soon uncovered a small
square opening, no larger, as the jailer’s wife had said,
than a good-sized hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>On her knees as she was, she bent her head down to
a level with the hole and put her lips close to the opening.
She tried to speak, but such a faintness came
upon her that she could not utter a sound. She had
worked with a tremendous resolution toward this end,
and now the flood of thoughts of everything said and
done that evening, came upon her and rendered her
dumb, with emotion and dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making a great effort she essayed to speak again.
Once more she failed. But she waited doggedly, for
the power she knew would not desert her in the end.
Thus for the third time she mustered all her strength
and leaned down to the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” she said, faintly, and then she waited,
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no response. There was not a sound from
that tomb, the dankness of which she now began to
detect in her nostrils.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam!” she repeated, this time more strongly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some subterranean rustling then came to her ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam! Oh, Adam!” she said, in a voice that
trembled uncontrollably.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s that? Who’s speaking? Is it you, John
Rosella?” came in a rumble from the dungeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>She failed to recognize his voice, so altered did the
passage from his place of imprisonment make it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“Oh, is that you, Adam—Mr. Rust?” she asked,
trembling violently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde!” he said, joyously. “Garde! Oh, my
darling! Yes, it’s I. Where are you? What have
you done?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde felt her strength leave her treacherously.
Thus to hear the endearing names leap upward to her
from that terrible place was too much to bear, after all
she had learned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here—here are the keys,” she whispered down to
him, haltingly. “And your friends—your two companions—they
are also in the prison. I hope—I hope
you can find your way out. I am dropping them down—the
keys. Here they come.” She tossed the bunch,
which she had taken from her pocket with nerveless
fingers, and now she heard the metallic clink, as they
struck the floor, come faintly up through the aperture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was starting to say something. She dared not
wait to listen. Now that her task was done, she knew
she would absolutely collapse, if she did not at once
bestir herself to flee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mustn’t stop!” she said to him, a little wildly.
“Be careful. Good-by,” and without even waiting to
hear him answer, she arose, thrust a bunch of grass
back into place over the opening, and hastened away.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>RATS IN THE ARMORY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam’s</span> disappointment, when he got no more responses
to the eager questions and blessings he breathed
upward to his unseen sweetheart, was keener than all
the anguish he had felt at being so foully imprisoned.
He had caught up the keys, quickly enough, but when
he failed to catch any more of her trembling words he
felt more deserted and surrounded by the blackness
than he had been in all this new experience. However,
his heart was soon tripping with gladness.</p>

<p class='c007'>At least it was Garde who had come to save him.
Love was his guardian angel. He could face the world
full of foes, after this. He grew impatient, abruptly,
to get out of the dungeon at once and go to Garde—his
brave, darling Garde!</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he thought of the beef-eaters. He had fancied
he heard their voices, as Randolph’s men had been taking
him into the prison corridor. It had seemed impossible
that they had already arrived and been apprehended
till he remembered how many days it had been
since last he had seen them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been asleep when Garde first called down to
him, through the tiny air-passage, the rover was a
little refreshed. But he was still nearly famished for
something to eat, having been provided only with a dry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>chunk of bread, as large as his fist, and a jug of water.
He was also quite lame, for he had not been able to do
anything for his wounded foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless he was alert, now, for his slumber of an
hour had been profoundly deep and his constitution
was one of great elasticity, rapidly responding to the
most inconsiderable restorative influence. He hobbled
about in his small den, finding the door without difficulty,
after which he tried the lock with key after key,
on the bunch, until he thought he had rejected all,
when his high hopes came swiftly tumbling down.</p>

<p class='c007'>The key to the dungeon had not been found among
the lot on the ring!</p>

<p class='c007'>In his weakened condition this apparent discovery
was prostrating in its dire effect. He suffered more
than he would have done had there been no attempt
made to free him at all. He felt cold beads of perspiration
break out on his brow. Hope for himself and the
beef-eaters, snatched away almost as soon as given, unnerved
him. Nevertheless he pulled himself together,
to try every key in the bunch again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first one he handled entered the lock and threw
back the bolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cautiously swinging the door open, he suddenly
started, at the sound of some one approaching in the
corridor. In a second he was back in the dark hole
and had locked the door again upon himself. Weaver,
the jailer, making an unusual round of the premises,
came down the dungeon-steps and tried the door.
Satisfied that all was well, he proceeded onward to his
bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam lost little time in again starting forth. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>time he locked the dungeon and took his bunch of keys
with him. He climbed the nine steps, which the jailer’s
wife had so frequently counted, and found himself in
the corridor, which was lighted by a single lamp, which
was small and odorous. Noting his bearings, he limped
along toward the cell where he thought he had heard
the beef-eaters talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no sound to give him guidance now, and
there were several doors confronting him, behind any
one of which his retinue might be locked. It was a
matter presenting necessities for nicety in judgment.
If he were to open the door on some wrong prisoner,
the ensuing disturbance would be most unfortunate.
Moreover, he did not know but what there might be
guards galore in some of the jail-apartments. It would
not do to call, or to whisper, for the sake of attracting
the beef-eaters’ attention, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing for it but to open door after door
till he found the faithful pair. Luckily the doors were
numbered, and he found there were corresponding
numbers on the keys. There being no choice, he unlocked
the first door he saw. Shifting the bolt cautiously,
he was presently able to listen for anything like
a sound inside the cell.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could hear nothing. The room was empty. To
the next door he went, and repeated his simple experiment.
This apartment proved to be, not a cell, but a
place in which all manner of rubbish had been thrown.
It also contained swords, pistols, some blunderbusses
and other arms. The room, indeed, was the prison
armory. Adam nodded at this discovery as being good,
but it left him as far as before from his friends. Leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>this door unlocked, he went back in the other direction
and tried again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Listening now, as before, upon opening a second cell,
he heard snoring. Better than this, it was snoring that
he knew. He went in and nudged the retinue with his
foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, ho! Who knocks?” said Halberd, in a sleepy
growl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be quiet,” said Adam. “Get up, the two of you,
quickly. We are about to seek more commodious
apartments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Sachem!” said Pike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who else,” answered Halberd. “Sire, I have been
expecting this kindness these three hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may expect to be hanged, in the morning, if
you do not shut your mouth and come with me instantly,”
said Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was dreaming of my wedding with a fair princess,”
said Pike. “These are no days of chivalry,
when a man will leave so sweet a damsel in so vile a
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you done with your swords and side
arms?” the Sachem demanded, in a whisper. “Did
they take them from you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They did. Else we had slain the whole score of
rascals that took us,” said Halberd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make haste, then, till we arm anew,” instructed the
rover.</p>

<p class='c007'>He locked the door behind them and led the way to
the armory at once. They had gone half the distance
to the place when there came a clanking of opening
doors, a rattle of scabbards, a rumble of muffled voices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and the tramp of many feet, around in the angle of the
corridor, leading to the outside world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick! Quick!” commanded Adam, and darting
forward, lame foot and all, to the armory-door, he opened
it, thrust in the beef-eaters, with a word of admonition
to beware of making a noise, and closed the barrier,
only as Randolph and six of his creatures came tiptoeing
down the passage and stopped fairly opposite
where Adam was standing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rover reached out in the dark of the room they
were in, as he braced silently against the door, and
felt his hand come in contact with a sword, which he
had noted when first he peered into the room. He
could hear the men outside, whispering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver was with them, pale and frightened at what
he knew these midnight visitors contemplated doing.
He dared not make the slightest protest; his master
stood before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, is this the room above the dungeon?” said
Randolph. He laid his hand on the knob, the inside
mate of which Adam was holding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, this is the room, here upon the other side,”
said Weaver. “It’s a few steps further along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The private executioners, with their chief, were
moving away, when one of the beef-eaters stepped upon
something on the floor of the armory, making a sound
that seemed terrific.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was that?” demanded Randolph, quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have rats in the property chamber,” said
Weaver, honestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounded too big for rats,” said the voice of
Psalms Higgler, whom Adam readily identified.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“We may look there if you like,” said the jailer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind the rats at present,” dictated Randolph.
“Show us the room above the cellar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other door could then be heard to open and to
close behind the visitors. Adam snatched up swords
for three on the instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, take it—and not a word,” he breathed,
thrusting a weapon upon each of his trembling companions.
“If they come for us—fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Silently and slowly he reopened the door, having
buckled a sword upon him. There came a light patter
of footsteps on the corridor floor. Just as the rover
was stepping forth, Psalms Higgler, who had not been
satisfied with the theory of the rats, came gliding to the
spot. He and Adam suddenly faced one another, a
foot apart. The startled little monster stared wildly
for the briefest part of a second and then would have
fallen back, yelling like a demon to raise the alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pouncing upon him, without a sound, yet with the
terrible strength and nimbleness of a tiger, Adam
clutched him fiercely by the neck, with both his powerful
hands, and choking back the yell already starting
to the creature’s lips, lifted him bodily off the floor, to
prevent him from kicking upon it, to raise a disturbance,
and carried him, squirming and writhing, to the
door by which the visitors had so recently entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Open the door! Open the door and get out!”
ordered Rust of his followers, sternly, never for a moment
relaxing his grip or his lift on Higgler. “Lift
the bar! Lift it! There!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The door swung open. The beef-eaters sprang outside,
trying both to go at once. The commotion they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>made rang through the building. Adam was after
them swiftly, forgetting to limp, as he felt the outside
air in his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Higgler by this was becoming absolutely limp.
Adam dropped him on the ground, where he lay,
barely left alive and unable to move or to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had the keys in his pocket, the largest one
uppermost. This was the one to this outside door.
He could hear the men inside running toward the spot
and already shouting the alarm. He dared to lock
the door, deliberately, and to pull out the key and put
it again in his pocket. Then he calmly drew the borrowed
sword from its scabbard, rammed its end smartly
home, in the key-hole and snapped it off short, spiking
the aperture completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already the beef-eaters were running up the street.
Psalms Higgler was drawing his breath in awful gasps,
where he lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good friend, farewell,” said Rust to him, cheerfully.
“I shall be pleased to report you an excellent
rat-catcher, at the earliest opportunity afforded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He disappeared from Higgler’s ken in a twinkling
and soon overtook his retinue, making good time for
the country.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LOVE’S LONG GOOD-BY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Aware</span> that his ruse in locking the jail upon his
jailers would hold them only till they could think of
taking off the lock and knocking out the sword-end,
Adam was nevertheless determined upon going to David
Donner’s residence, for the purpose of seeing Mistress
Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this purpose in view, and expecting his pursuers
to be soon on a keen race for the open flats,
which he had been known to cross before, in his successful
escape to the woods, he led his retinue straight
off at right angles from such a course, and brought
them in fifteen minutes to the silent ship-yard of
William Phipps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, with small ado, they climbed the fence and
struck across the enclosure, past the gaunt skeleton of
a ship, growing on the ways, and so came to a quiet bit
of water, at the private landing, where three small
boats were moored in safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trio were soon aboard the lightest skiff and rowing
her westward, with silent, effectual strokes.
Guided by the rover, the beef-eaters steered for the
shore, and after a ten-minute pull Adam landed near
the spot where he had sat upon a rock, waiting for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>night, on the occasion of his last meeting with his
sweetheart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait for me here,” he said. “I shall not be long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was soon at the gate and then in the garden.
There was not a sound to be heard. The house was
dark. He raised a little whistle, as he slowly walked
about the place, watching the windows intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde heard him. She was up. She had not had a
moment of peace or freedom from dreadful suspense
since arriving at the house, while waiting, listening,
starting at all those uncanny sounds of stretching, in
which a building will indulge itself at night. Greater
unhappiness or despair she had never known, nor
greater worry, fearing that Adam would come, and
then fearing more that he would not.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she heard him whistle, her heart seemed suddenly
dislodged in her bosom. Her breath came
laboredly. She opened the window in the kitchen,
this room being furthest from her grandfather’s apartment,
and saw Adam limp eagerly toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde!—Sweetheart!” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh—oh, you—you got away,” she faltered, faintly.
“Here, I have—tied you up—a luncheon. Take it,
please, and—and you had better go—at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“God bless you!” said Adam, stuffing the parcel
she gave him inside his coat. “I have brought you
back the keys. My Garde! My own blessed sweetheart.
Oh, Garde, dearest, come out to me, just for a
moment—just for one little good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I cannot,” Garde said, fighting heroically against
the greatest temptation she had ever known. “We
must say——good-by, now, and I must——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“Yes, I know, dear,” he broke in impetuously, “but
just for a moment, just——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was at the window. He tried to take her hands,
to draw her toward him. She shrank away with an
action so strange that his sentence died on his lips.
“Why, Garde,” he said, “can’t I even touch your
hands?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shook her head. He could barely see her, in the
pale light which the stars diffused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I must never see—never see you—again,” she
stammered, painfully, “we must say—say good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must never——Garde—why—we must say—But,
Garde, dear,—I don’t understand you. What
does all this mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, please go—now,” she said. “That is all—all
I can say. It must be good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was made dumb for a moment. He stared at
her unbelievingly. He passed his hand across his
brow, as if he feared his fasting and long-endured labors
had weakened his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in heaven’s name has happened?” he said,
as if partially to himself. “Am I Adam Rust? Are
you Garde? Say good-by?——Dearest, has anything
happened?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She nodded to him, forcing back the sob that arose
in her throat. “Something—something has happened,”
she repeated. For maidenly shame she could not
broach the subject of the Indian child.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was silent for a moment before replying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you came to-night and gave me the keys, an
hour or so ago,” he said, in wonderment and confusion.
“You did that?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“I—couldn’t—do less,” she answered, mastering her
love and anguish by a mighty resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean—you would have done the same for
anybody?” he asked. And seeing her nod an affirmative
he gave a little laugh. “I am crazy now, or I
have been crazy before,” he told himself. “Something
has happened. Something—Of course—it couldn’t
help happening, in time. Some one has told you——I
might have known it would happen.... And yet—you
once said you could wait for me fifty years. And I believed
it.... Well, I thank you. I have been amused.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His broken sentences seemed to Garde to fill in the
possible gaps of the story—to make his confession
complete. But Adam had, in reality, stopped himself
on the verge of accusing her of listening to the love-making
of some one other than himself, in his absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made no reply to what he had said. She felt
there was absolutely nothing she could say. Her heart
would have cried out to him wildly. When he spoke
so lightly of the fifty years which she could have
waited, she swayed where she stood, ready to drop.
Almost one atom more of impulse and she would have
thrown herself in his arms, crying out her love passionately,
in defiance of the story of his perfidy. But
her honor, her maidenly resolution, steeled her in the
nick of time. Though her heart should break, she
could not accept the gilded offer of such a love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Garde—sweetheart, forgive me,” said Adam,
after a moment of terrible silence. “I have wronged
you. Forgive me and tell me it is all some nightmare—some
dreadful——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The night stillness was broken by the sound of men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>running swiftly up the street. Randolph had thought
of the possibility of Adam’s visit to Mistress Merrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde heard and comprehended. Rust heard and
was careless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, go, Ad—Mr. Rust, please go at once,” pleaded
the girl already closing down the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde! Garde!—not forever?” cried the man in
a last despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forever,” she answered, so faintly that he barely
heard, and then the window came down to its place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Limping back into the shadow, at the rear of the
garden, Adam lay out full length on the ground, as
two tiptoeing figures entered the gate and came sneaking
silently about the somber house. He saw them
make a circuit of the garden. One of them walked to
within a rod of where he lay—therefore within a rod of
death,—and then turned uncertainly away and retired
from the place with his fellow-hound.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rover heard them go on up the street, hurriedly
making toward the woods. He came back to the place
by the window, at last, and whistled softly once again,
unable to believe that what he had heard could be so.
There must be some explanation, if only he could get
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no response, partially for the reason that
Garde had sunk down upon the floor, on the other side
of the window, in a dead faint.</p>

<p class='c007'>His lameness fully upon him again, Adam hobbled a
few steps away, halted to look back, yearningly, and
then once more dragged himself off, to join the faithful
beef-eaters, waiting in patience with the boat.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>MUTATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>While</span> Garde, heart-broken, pale and ill, was restoring
her uncle’s keys to their accustomed hook, in the
morning, Adam and his retinue were taking a much-needed
sleep in the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having recovered his own good sword and his leather
jerkin, from the place where he had concealed them, on
the evening of his capture, he had led the beef-eaters
into a maze of trees where no one in Boston could have
found them, and here he was doing his best to prove
himself a cheerful and worthy companion, to share their
natural distresses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Refusing at first to eat of the luncheon provided by
Garde, the rover finally yielded to the importunities of
his companions, and thereby got much-needed refreshment.
By noon they were far on their way toward New
Amsterdam, their only safe destination. They kept
close to the edge of the woods, as they went, remaining
thereby in touch with the farms, on which they depended,
in their penniless condition, for something to
eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>By sheer perversity, Adam wore away his lameness.
He bathed his foot often and he also wrapped it in
leaves, the beneficent qualities of which he had learned
from the Indians, years before, and this did as much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>or more, than his doggedness to make repairs in the
injured tendons.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were many days on this wearisome march which
contrasted, for Adam, so harshly with that other stroll,
to Boston, from Plymouth. On many occasions they
went hungry for a day and a night together. But what
with cheer and good water, they lost nothing of their
health.</p>

<p class='c007'>With boots beginning to gape at the toes, and with
raiment dusty and faded, they arrived, at last, at the
modest house, at the corner of Cedar and William
streets, in New Amsterdam, where Captain William
Kidd resided with his wife. Here they were made
welcome. On behalf of himself and his comrades, Adam
presently secured a working passage to Hispaniola,
where he meant to rejoin William Phipps, in the search
for the sunken treasure. He could think of nothing
else to do, and he had no longer the slightest desire to
remain on American soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prior to sailing, however, he wrote a long, detailed
account of his finding the man and his Indian child,
with all the incidents related thereto, which he forwarded
straight to Henry Wainsworth. This concluded
his duties. He only regretted, he said in his letter to
Henry, that he could not apprise him of what disposition
had been made of the body of the little man,
Henry’s nephew, when the minions of Randolph took
it in their charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This letter came duly into Henry Wainsworth’s possession.
Having been aware, as no other man in Massachusetts
was, that his refugee brother was living his
isolated life in the woods, Henry was much overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>by this sad intelligence. He made what cautious inquiries
he dared, with the purpose of ascertaining what
had become of the little body. He then made a
pilgrimage into the woods, stood above the grave which
Adam had made, and then, taking a few worthless
trinkets, as mementoes, from the deserted cabin, he
came sadly away.</p>

<p class='c007'>But not Henry’s sadness, nor yet that of Garde,
served to do more than to signalize the sense of affliction
which the citizens of the colony felt had come upon
them. They had been a joyless people, with their
minds and their bodies dressed in the somber hues suggested
by a morbid condition of religious meditation,
but at least they had enjoyed the freedom for which
they had come so far and fought so persistently. With
their charter gone, and the swift descent upon them of
the many things which they had found intolerable in
England, they were a melancholy, hopeless people indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even as Garde’s sorrow typified that of her fellow-beings,
so did the fortitude and uncomplaining courage,
with which she endured her burden, typify the
stolid suffering of the citizens of Massachusetts, in this
hour of their first great “national” woe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The summer ripened and passed. The autumn
heralded the ermine-robed King Winter, with glorious
pageantry. The trees put on their cloth of gold and
crimson, and when the hoary monarch came, the millions
of leaves strewed his path, and, prostrate before
his march, laid their matchless tapestry beneath his
merciless feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all this time Randolph had made no sign toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>his revenge upon Garde, for the scorn with which
she had cast him from her side. No petty vengeance
would gratify his malignant spirit. The whole colony
must suffer for this indignity, and Garde and her
grandfather should feel his hand mightily, when all was
ready. He prepared his way with extreme caution.
He was never hurried. He laid wires to perform his
mischief far ahead. Indeed he lingered almost too
long, in his greed to prolong his own anticipation of
what was to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in December of that year, 1686, the frigate
“Kingfisher,” from England, brought to the colony
their newly-appointed Governor, Sir Edmund Andros,
who assumed the reins of power with an absolute thoroughness
which left Randolph somewhat shorn of his
capacity for working evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andros, who had formerly been Governor for New
York, for a matter of three years, was a person of commendable
character, in many respects, but the policy
which he had come to put into being and force was
stupid, oppressive and offensive to the people he had to
govern. Being the thorough Tory that he was, he enforced
the policy with a vigor which brought upon him
the detestation of the Puritans, who visited the errors
he was ordered to commit upon his own less guilty
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Puritans, in the extremes to which they had
fled, in their separation from the English forms of worship,
had adopted a rigid simplicity in which the whole
fabric of ceremonials had been swept away bodily.
They rang no bells for their divine service; they regarded
marriage as a civil contract, purely; they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>observed no festivals nor holidays of the church; they
buried their dead in stolid silence. They abhorred the
English rites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor Andros inaugurated countless ceremonies.
That very Christmas the English party of Boston held
high revel in the city. The Puritans refused to close
their shops, or to join either in rites or merriment.
They brought in their fire-wood and went about their
business, grim-faced and scowling darkly upon the innovations
come among them, with their fascinations for
the young and their enchantment of the frivolous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The offenses against their rigid notions increased
rapidly. In February they beheld, with horror, the
introduction of a new invention of the devil. One
Joseph Mayhem paraded in the main street of Boston
with a rooster fastened on his back,—where it flapped
its wings frantically,—while in his hand the fellow
carried a bell, on which he made a dreadful din as
he walked. Behind him came a number of ruffians,
blindfolded and armed with cart-whips. Under pretense
of striking at Mayhem and the chanticleer, they
cut at the passers-by, roaring with laughter and otherwise
increasing the attention which their conduct
attracted. This exhibition was thought to smack of
Papacy and the hated days of Laud.</p>

<p class='c007'>The church itself was invaded. There was as yet no
Church of England in the town. Governor Andros
therefore attended with the Puritans, at their own
house of meeting, but to their unnameable horror, he
compelled Goodman Needham, the sexton, to ring the
bell, according to English usage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rebellion being impossible, the Puritans nursed their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>grievances in sullen stolidity. They were powerless,
but never hopeless of their opportunity still to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taxation came as a consequence of the pomp in which
the new Governor conceived it to be his right to exist,
as well as the natural result of his glowing reports to
England that the people could be made to disgorge and
would not resist.</p>

<p class='c007'>To crown their heritage of woe, Edward Randolph,
profiting by their already established fanaticism and
ripeness for the folly, subtly introduced and finally
fastened upon them that curse of superstitious ignorance,
which was doomed to become such a blot upon
their page of history—the “detection” of and persecutions
for witchcraft.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GOLDEN OYSTERS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Captain William Phipps</span>, when Adam left him at
Jamaica, had returned, as he had said he intended, to
the waters wherein the old Spanish galleon, with her
golden treasure, was supposed to have sunk. He had
met with a small measure of luck, for an old sailor had
pointed out what he alleged to be the exact reef of
rocks on which the galleon had split, half a century before.
This spot was a few leagues to the north of Port
de la Plata.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having examined the place without success, Phipps
had then discovered that his crew was not reliable and
the ship not much better, in point of soundness. He
had therefore headed for England, coming in due season
to anchor in the Thames.</p>

<p class='c007'>Undaunted by the failure which his enterprise had
been, he sought out the King, reported what he had
done, and requested the use of another ship and a better
lot of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>James was amused and entertained. He commended
the bold skipper on his courage and his tenacity of purpose;
he believed his story. But he shook his head
at the thought of furnishing funds and a new ship and
crew for further adventures with pirates and mutineers
in the Spanish Main.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>However, at the Court, Captain Phipps had made
influential friends. He was admired for his manly
qualities; he was trusted as a man of exceptional integrity.
The Duke of Albemarle, with several friends,
agreed again to back the doughty Captain for the venture.
They secured a new charter for the business
from the King; they found a good staunch ship.
Away went Phipps, with a hope so high that nothing
could have served to suppress it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was when the captain arrived once more at Port
de la Plata that Adam Rust and the beef-eaters joined
him. The meeting was one in which the demonstration
of a great and enduring affection between the two big
men was the more affecting because of its utter simplicity
and quietness. Adam was welcomed to his
share in the new promise with that great spirit of generosity
and justice which characterized everything that
Phipps was ever known to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparations for a careful search were pushed
ahead rapidly. A small, stout boat was built and
launched, near the fatal reef, while the ship was anchored
at some distance away, in less treacherous water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daily the small boat put forth and the reef was examined,
but to no avail. It was found that the shelf
of rock, which had broken the old galleon, ended so
abruptly as to form a sheer drop of many fathoms,
whereas a few feet away it was only a ship’s-hold distance
from the surface. It was conjectured then that
the galleon had struck, had filled with water and so had
fallen over the edge of the submerged precipice,
where she would lay forever, undisturbed by prodding
man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>The search was at length abandoned as being futile.
The small boat, being slowly rowed away, Adam beheld
a plant, of many colors and rare beauty, growing on
the reef below them, in the clear, emerald water. He
requested a diver to fetch it up. The boat was halted
and overboard went the man. He was soon seen
spraddling like some singular creature, back up through
the brine. He had fetched the plant and he told of
having seen on the bottom the encrusted gun of some
sunken vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Adam’s eager command he returned again to the
spot and presently arose to the surface with an ingot of
silver, slimy and dark, clutched firmly in his hands.
The treasure was found!</p>

<p class='c007'>Putting for the ship at once, where Captain Phipps
was somewhat laboriously writing a long report of the
second failure, the rover gave the almost incredible
news, that set the whole ship afire with amazement
and joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire crew were speedily pressed into service.
The work was prosecuted with vigor. Adam looked
upon this treasure, coming so late into his sight and
life, with a grim smile upon his lips and with scorn in
his eyes. He saw the divers fetch up masses of bullion,
first, then golden oysters, encrusted with calcareous
matter, then broken bags bursting with their largess of
Spanish doubloons, and finally precious stones, shimmering,
untarnished, in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a feverish time. Day after day went by and
the boats were filled with fortunes. It seemed as if
the more they took, the more they found. The gold
on top hid gold underneath.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>An old shipmate of Captain Phipps’ whose imagination
the ship-builder had fired, months before,
arrived from Providence. He was able so easily to fill
his boat with gold that he went raving crazy and died
in a lunatic asylum at Bermuda.</p>

<p class='c007'>The provisions on the ship began to run low, before
the examination of the sunken wreck was complete.
Moreover the sailors, their avariciousness aroused by
the sight of all these riches, which daily they were
snatching from the sea, for other men to enjoy, grew
restive and threatened to take a contagion of mutiny.</p>

<p class='c007'>Treasure to the value of three hundred thousand
pounds had been recovered, and much still remained
untouched. Phipps determined to sail with what he
had, planning to return to the field in the future. He
enjoined silence and secrecy on all the sailors, but the
word leaked out and adventurers gathering from far
and near, the rotting galleon was despoiled of everything
she had hoarded so jealously and successfully
throughout the years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps brought his vessel in safety to England. The
enormous success which had attended his efforts so
aroused the cupidity of certain of the King’s retainers
that they advised James to confiscate the entire treasure,
on the ground that Phipps had withheld such
information, on his former return, as would have induced
the crown to finance the second enterprise, had
the truth been told.</p>

<p class='c007'>King James, however, was too honorable a monarch
to resort to trickery so infamous. Instead he commended
the captain in the highest terms, made him
an intimate of his court, knighted him Sir William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Phipps and invited him to become an Englishman and
reside with them there for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps received his honors modestly. He was too
patriotic to desert America and bluntly said so to his
King. He and Adam received, as their share of the
treasure, the one tenth agreed upon, amounting to
thirty thousand pounds, of which sum all that the
Captain could prevail upon Rust to accept was a third,
a sum, the rover said, far in excess of the needs of his
retinue and himself.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XLI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>FATE’S DEVIOUS WAYS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>At</span> Boston it was not a matter of many months before
Henry Wainsworth and piety Tootbaker, having been
made aware that Garde was no longer provisionally betrothed
to Randolph, resumed their former hopes and
attentions, as to attending Meeting and paying sundry
little visits to the Soams, when Garde could be expected
to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde had become a subdued little person, wishing
only that she might not be seen by any one as she came
and went on her simple rounds of daily life. Her
grandfather had recovered so that once more he pothered
about in his garden and read in his Bible and
busied himself with prattle, more childish than wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man saw little of his compatriots. He lived
as one only partially awake from a recent dread. He
never discussed the colony’s politics, for his friends,
when they came to see him, spared him the ordeal
which invariably resulted from a mention of the word
charter. On this topic he was quite mad. Almost
galvanically, the word produced in his brain a mania,
half fear, half fury, in which he seemed to conceive
that Garde was the author of woes to which nothing
could ever give expression. In such a mood, he was
savagery itself, toward the patient girl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Gradually, so gradually that she could not have said
when the impression commenced to grow upon her, Garde
discovered that Henry Wainsworth was exceedingly
kind, thoughtful and soothing, in her joyless existence.
There was something kindred in his own isolation, and in
his very bashfulness, or timidity, for it kept him so often
silent, when he was with her alone. She had always respected
Henry. His patient devotion could not but touch
her at length. It was not so much a flattery as it was a
faithfulness, through all the discouragements she had
given him always.</p>

<p class='c007'>This line of thought having been awakened in her
breast, she noted more of the little, insignificant signs
which go to make up the sum of a man’s real regard—the
regard on which a woman can safely rely as one to
endure and to grow.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the soreness of her heart, it was almost sweet to
think of Henry’s quiet attentions. It was calming.
It lent a little spot of warmth and color to her otherwise
cheerless life. She could never love him, as she
had loved Adam—nay, as she loved him still,—but the
dreariness of her present days might find relief in a new
sort of life. Out of the duties, which as a housewife
she would experience daily, surely a trust, an esteem
for Henry, great enough almost to be called a love,
would come, with the years.</p>

<p class='c007'>She yearned to bury her sorrow. It was not a healthy,
wholesome thing for any young woman to foster. She
had enjoyed her day of love, yes—her years of love.
She had felt like a widowed bride. To her, Adam’s
kisses had been like the first sacred emblems of their
marriage. She had not been able to conceive of permitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>such caresses until she should feel that their souls
were mated and their hearts already wedded. But it
could never be the duty of a woman to mourn such a loss
till she died. And then—this newly contemplated
union would make her forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, if she could encourage Henry toward this possibility
of a union such as she thought upon, it would
be her duty to be more cheerful, more living in the
every-day hours that were, instead of dreaming sadly
and morbidly upon her heart-break of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not with a sense of gratifying her own longing
for happiness that she finally thought a marriage with
Henry possible; there was a sense of combating her
own selfishness in it. It was a selfishness, it was pampering
the morbid in her nature, she felt, to continue
indefinitely in a “widowhood” of Adam’s love. It
must also be admitted that Garde was human, wherefore
the element of pique was not absolutely lacking in
her being. No woman would ever wish a man she had
rejected to believe that she could not, or would not,
marry elsewhere. She would wish to show that other
opportunities were not lacking, as well as she would
desire to have him know that her heart was not broken
beyond repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having spent at least a month upon these introspective
and other meditations, Garde appeared to Wainsworth
so much more bright and beautiful that there
was no containing his emotions. The poor fellow nearly
broke his neck, metaphorically speaking, in a vain attempt
to ask her to become his wife, on the first occasion
afforded, after he made his discovery of her alteration
in moods and appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>It was of no use to screw up his courage. It would
not stick. He determined to write what he could not
utter, and then, when a moment should be propitious,
to deliver his written declaration into her hand, to be
read when he had fled the scene. To this end he composed
an elegant and eloquent epistle.</p>

<p class='c007'>To avoid any possibility of making mistakes, Henry
carefully deposited his letter in the pocket of the coat
he always wore to Meeting. This pocket had been heretofore
employed as a receptacle for things precious
over which he desired to exercise particular care.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having without difficulty obtained permission from
Garde to walk at her side to church and back, poor
Wainsworth lost appetite and sleep, while waiting for
the fateful day. When it came, he was in a nervous
plight which revealed to Garde the whole state of his
mind. She felt her sympathy for him expand in her
bosom till she hoped it would burgeon into love. Had
he gone with her into her aunt Gertrude’s home, after
the service, Garde would doubtless have helped to simplify
what she was well aware he wished to say, but, alas
for the timid lover, he dared not, on this occasion, so
jeopardize his courage.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that if ever he got inside the house and
faced her, alone, he would not be able even to deliver
his letter. But out of doors his nerve was steadier.
Therefore, at the gate having fortified himself against
the moment, he nervously drew from his pocket a good-sized
packet of paper and put it shakingly into her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish—I wish you would read—this letter,” he
stammered. “Good-by. I—I hope you will read it
quite through.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Garde looked at him compassionately. He was only
made the more confused. He bowed himself away with
a nervousness painful to see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Henry!” said Garde, with a little smile to herself.
She knew what to expect in the document and
vaguely she wondered if she would not feel more at
peace when she had consented to become his wife.
Her memory of words and looks, behind which the
figure of Adam, the sad boy-captive, the love-irradiated
champion of her cat, and then the melancholy violinist
in the woods—this had all, of late, been more than
usually strong upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde’s cat had died within the week just passed.
This event had served to open up old tombs, containing
her dead dreams. She had almost caught herself wishing
she had taken less to heart the story of Adam’s
perfidy, or at least that she might never have heard the
story at all. But when she had shaken off the spell
which this past would persist in weaving about her, she
was resolved to accept Henry Wainsworth, so that her
duty might compel her to forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a half melancholy sense of sealing her own sentence
of banishment from her land of bitter-sweet memories,
she delayed the moment of unfolding Henry’s
letter. When she found herself alone, she laid it down
before her, on the table, and looked at it with lackluster
eyes. But presently, then, having tossed off the
reverie which was stealing upon her, she sighed once,
heavily, and took up the papers with a resolute hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She opened the stiff sheets and bent them straight.
She read “Dear friend,” and thought Henry’s writing
had altered. Her eyes then sped along a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>lines and she started with a new, tense interest in the
document.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter she held in her hands was the one which
Adam Rust had penned to Wainsworth, concerning his
brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why!” she presently said, aloud, “why—he
couldn’t have meant—” yet Henry, she recalled, had
asked her particularly to read all the pages through.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had only made a start into Adam’s narrative, yet
her heart had begun to leap till she could barely endure
its commotion. She spread the sheets out before her
on the table, with nervous fingers. She read swiftly,
greedily. Her bosom heaved with the tumult of suddenly
stirred emotions. She made a glad little noise,
as she read, for the undercurrent of her thought was
of a wild exultation to find that Adam was innocent,
that she was justified in loving him now, as she had been
justified always—that her instinct had guided her
rightly when she had helped him to break from the
prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes were widely dilated. Her pent-up emotions
swayed her till she suddenly clutched up the sheets and
crumpled them in joy against her bounding heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam!” she said, half aloud. “Oh, Adam! My
Adam!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She bent above the letter again, crooning involuntarily,
in the revelation of Adam made again his noble self
by the lines he had written so simply and innocently
here upon the paper. She was reading, but having,
almost in the first few lines, discovered so much that
her intuition had far out-raced her eyes, she was hardly
comprehending the sentences that ran so swiftly beneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>her gaze, so abandoned were her senses to the
sudden hope and the overwhelming joy which the revelation
compelled. She kissed the papers. She laid
her cheek upon them, she surrounded them warmly
with her arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>She felt so glad that she had loved him in spite of that
horrible story! Her soul leaped with exultation. She
would not be obliged to marry Wainsworth, to forget.
She would never forget! She would wait for Adam
now—if need be till Judgment Day itself!</p>

<p class='c007'>She kissed Adam’s writing again. She fondled it
lovingly. It restored him. It gave her back her right
to love him. It was too much to think upon or to try
to express.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had only half read it; the sense of the story had
escaped her grasp. It had been enough that Adam was
guiltless. Her breath came fast; the color had flamed
to her cheeks. Her eyes were glowing with the love
which she had welcomed home to her throbbing
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had risen, unable to control herself, so abruptly
and unexpectedly had the discovery come upon her.
Now she sat down again at the table and read the letter
more carefully. It was such a sad little story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unfortunately I sprained my ankle, and this delayed
me,” she read, where Adam had written. She
pictured him now, limping through the forest, with the
little brown child, and her heart yearned over his suffering,
his patience and his self-sacrifice in coming back to
the cruel fate in store for him, there in Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought of him then in the prison. She blessed
the instinct of love which had made her go to his aid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>He was not an outlaw. He was not a renegade. He
was her own Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she thought of the moment in which she had
sent him away. After all the heart-breaking trials he
had already endured, she had added the final cruelty.
She remembered how he had limped, when she saw him
starting off, just before she had fainted at the window,
that terrible night. Longing to call him back, now, and
to cry out her love,—that had never died,—her trust,
which should now endure for ever, and her plea to be forgiven,
she fancied she heard him again saying: “Garde!
Garde!—not forever?” and she felt a great sob rising in
her throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam!” she said, as if from the depths of her
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hot tears, of joy and sadness blended, suddenly
gave vent to the pent-up emotions within her. They
rolled swiftly down across her face and splashed in great
blots on the writing.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XLII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>LITTLE RUSES, AND WAITING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>When</span> she had recovered somewhat of her calm again,
Garde found herself confronted by several difficulties
with which she would be obliged to cope. In the first
place she had ruined Adam’s letter to Henry Wainsworth,
crumpling the sheets and permitting her tears to
fall upon their surfaces, till no one save herself, aided
by love, could have deciphered some of the sentences
at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, if Henry had really intended to
ask her hand in marriage, as she could not avoid believing,
there might be complications in that direction
at an early date. She could only resolve, upon this
point, that she must not, under any circumstances, permit
Henry to make his proposal, either orally or through
the medium of another letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to this letter, from Adam to Henry, it was certainly
of a private character, but Henry had asked her to read
it, and now she could not have disguised the fact that
she had done so. She could not see how she could possibly
return it to Henry at all, under the circumstances.
She could not bear to think of letting him see the evidence
of her emotions, wrought upon it. Moreover,
it was precious to her. She felt entitled to own it. To
her it meant far more than it possibly could to any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>person in the world. She resolved to make a fair copy
of it, for Henry, while she herself would retain the
original—in Adam’s own writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her third proposition was the most vital of them all.
She could not think of what she should do to repair the
harm which she alone, after all, had done, when she
sent Adam away with that little word “Forever!”
How should she let him know of the infamous story
which she had been made to believe? How should she
convince him, even supposing she could reach him with
a word, that the story had left no room in her mind for
doubt of its truth? How could she manage to persuade
him that she had loved him always; that she knew at
last of the wrong she had done him; that she begged
his forgiveness; that she should wait for him even longer
than the fifty years of which he had spoken on that last
agonizing night?</p>

<p class='c007'>He might not forgive her, she told herself. It might
be too late already. She knew not where he had gone,
or what he had done. He too might have thought of
marriage with somebody else—to try to forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of her brain cudgeling, to know what she
would do to make Adam aware that she had made a
great mistake and desired his forgiveness, she determined
to write him a letter. Having decided, she wrote
at once. Had she waited a little longer, her letter
might have been more quiet in its reserve, but it could
not then have been so utterly spontaneous, nor expressive
of the great love she bore him, kept alive during
all those months of doubt and agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was, the little outburst was sufficiently dignified;
and it was sweet, and frank. She told him that she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>read his letter to Henry, and that suddenly she had
known of the great wrong she had done him. She
mentioned that a dreadful story had been fastened upon
him, with all too terrible semblances of truth and justice.
She begged his forgiveness in a hundred runes.
Finally, when she had finished, she signed it “Garde—John
Rosella,” in memory of her walk with him through
the woods, from near Plymouth to Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not without blushes and little involuntary thrills of
delight did she add the name which confessed the tale
of that wonderful walk, but she felt that Adam would
know, by this very confession, how deep for him must
be her love and trust and how contrite was the spirit in
which she desired his forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'>This epistle having at length been disposed of to her
satisfaction, she made the fair copy of Adam’s letter to
Henry and sent it to Wainsworth at once, with a short
note of explanation that some moisture having fallen
upon the original, making it quite illegible and indeed
destroying it utterly, for his use, she felt she could do
no less than to make this reparation. She likewise expressed
the compliment she felt it was to herself that
Henry had desired her to know of this sad affair in the
life of his brother, but that she had been so affected by
the tale that she must beg him not to permit her to
read any further letters for some time to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a masterly composition, for poor Wainsworth
destroyed the proposing epistle he had written at such
infinite pains, and for a time, wholly abandoned any
thought of speaking of marriage. He was exceedingly
mortified to think he had made such a blunder as to
give her the letter which he had guarded so cautiously.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Timidity settled upon him, especially as he noted another,
altogether incomprehensible change in Garde’s
demeanor, when next they met.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having despatched her letter to Adam, Garde felt a
happiness grow and expand in her bosom daily. She
expected the wait to be a long one, till a letter, or some
other manner of a reply, could come from Adam.
Goodwife Phipps, of whom she had artfully contrived
to get the rover’s address, had assured her of the very
great number of weeks that elapsed between communications
from William, in answer to the fond little flock
of letters which she was constantly launching forth to
the distant island across the sea. But when weeks became
months, and time fled onward inexorably, with
never a sign or a word in return for what she had written,
she had many moments in which sad, vain regrets
and confirmed despair took possession of her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a resigned, patient girl, however, with her
impulses curbed, for the sadness of the times, aside
from her own little affairs, cast a gloom upon the colony
which seemed to deepen rather than to promise ever to
dissolve.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her heart felt that the fifty years had passed many
times over her head, when, after a longer time than
Mrs. Phipps had mentioned as sufficient to bring even
a delayed reply had passed, and nothing had come from
Adam Rust. Garde watched for the ships to come, one
by one, her hopes rising always as the white sails appeared,
and then falling invariably, when no small
messenger came to her hand. She lived from ship to
ship, and sent her own little argosies of thought traveling
wistfully across the seas, hoping they might come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>to harbor in Adam’s heart at last and so convey to him
her yearning to hear just a word, or to see him just
once again.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, she could not endure the thought
that either Henry Wainsworth or Piety Tootbaker
should even so much as think of her as if they stood in
Adam’s place. She therefore went to work with all her
maidenly arts, to render such a situation impossible, in
the case of either of the would-be suitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus she contrived to tell the faithful Henry that
Prudence Soam was very fond of him indeed. For this
she had a ground work of fact. She then conveyed to
Prudence the intelligence that Henry was thinking upon
her most fondly. This also began soon to be true
enough, for Henry had been flattered, not a little, by
the news he heard and did look at Prudence with a new
and wondering interest. He likewise underwent a process
of added intelligence in which he realized that
Garde was not for him, howsoever much he might have
dreamed, or would be able to dream in the future. It
was remarkable, then, how soon the timid Henry and
the diffident Prudence began to understand one
another. Prudence, who had never had a sweetheart
before, blossomed out with pretty little ways and with
catching blushes and looks of brightness in her eyes
that made her a revelation, not only to Henry but to
Garde herself. And Henry became really happy and
almost bold.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Piety, alas, there was no Prudence available.
Garde racked her brains for a plan to fit the case of
Tootbaker’s state of mind. At length, when John
Soam began to talk to his wife about the colony patriots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>again desiring that money which had never been
used to send David Donner abroad, for the purpose of
sending somebody else, in the spring, Garde knew exactly
what to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would manage to send Piety Tootbaker away to
England. She went to work in this direction without
delay. Her success was not a thing of sudden growth.
It took no little time and persuasion to fire Piety with
an ambition to serve his country by going so far from
his comfortable home and his equally comfortable
wooing, in which he believed he was making actual
progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>For their agent extraordinary, to plead their cause
at the Court of King James, the colonists selected
Increase Mather, a man at once astute, agreeable and
afflicted with religious convictions which had every barnacle
of superstition that ever lived, attached upon
them. Piety Tootbaker was to go as his clerk and
secretary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparations for sending Mather abroad were
conducted with no small degree of secrecy. Nevertheless
Edward Randolph became aware of what was being
contemplated, for his hypocritical Puritan agents were
everywhere and in all affairs of state, or even of private
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Permitting the scheme to ripen, Randolph waited
until almost the moment for Mather’s sailing. He then
swooped down upon the enterprise and attempted to
arrest Mather, on the process of some sham prosecution.
The patriots, incensed almost to the point of rebellion,
played cunning for cunning. They delayed the departure
of the ship, the captain of which was a staunch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>“American,” and then hustled Mather aboard under
cover of darkness, and so sent him off on his mission.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a week after Piety had gone, Garde felt such a
sense of relief that she almost persuaded herself she
was happy in her long wait for Adam, or for a word
which might finally come. But the months again
began their dreary procession, and her fear that Adam
was lost to her forever deepened and laid its burden
more and more upon her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet there came a day when, a ship having arrived in
the harbor, and her hope having greeted it wistfully,
only to flutter back to her own patient bosom again, a
letter did actually come to her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not particularly neat; it looked as if it might
have been opened before it came to her possession, but
her heart bounded wildly when she saw it, and her
fingers trembled as she broke it open to read its contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then her joy vanished. The letter was from Piety
Tootbaker. He announced, as if to break the intelligence
to her frankly, that the voyage had made him so
exceedingly ill that he had determined never to trust
himself upon the billows again. He would therefore
reside hereafter in England, which was “a pleasing
countrie and much more merrie than Boston.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall never, never get an answer to my letter,”
said Garde to herself, made sadder by the arrival of
Piety’s letter, which proved that letters could actually
come from over the sea. “He will never, never reply,
I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not far mistaken, for Adam had never received
her letter. It had fallen into the hands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Edward Randolph, who had constituted himself censor
of communications sent abroad from Massachusetts.
Malignantly he was keeping those love-scented sheets,
against the day of his vengeance.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A TOPIC AT COURT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> the midst of a gay throng, in the production of
which the Court of King James lagged little, if any,
behind that of his brother, Charles, Adam Rust and
Captain Phipps were prime favorites. Sir William,
who had adopted a cane, gave no promise that he would
ever be at home with the disciples of the minuet and
the hunt, while Adam seemed a very part of the social
mechanism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richly dressed, ready with his wit and his sword,
handsome, wealthy enough to attract the soft glances
of dames of all ages and degrees, he was a puzzle to the
blunt captain, who had marked a change that had come
upon him between going home from Jamaica and coming
back again to help in recovering the treasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whitehall was ablaze with light and warmth, which
were reflected from myriad sparkling jewels and from
rosy cheeks. The King had disappointed his guests,
nevertheless they were not at a loss to find amusement.
Ready as ever to entertain, either with a song for the
ladies or a duel with the men, Adam was pressed for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>roundel to fit the merry hour. He had found a glass
which responded with a particularly musical tinkle to
the tap of his finger. He held it up before the admiring
company and rang it crisply. Catching the key
from its mellifluous tintinnabulation he began his song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh your jolliest girl is your cup of sack,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Your Mistress Sack, with her warm, brown eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>She’ll love you, and never she’ll turn her back,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Nor leave you a thought</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Not being at all certain that they knew what he
meant, the company applauded with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my dear sir,” said a nobleman, with a head on
him hardly bigger nor less wrinkled than a last winter’s
apple, and a stomach as big as a tun, “you have not
tasted a drink to-night. Demme, look at me, sir. I
love my sack and my wine. I know nothing of your
poison cup, and I have no wish to, demme. But, sir, I
think you have no bowels for drinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord, you furnish the bowels and I will furnish
the brains to know about drinking,” said Adam. “By
my faith, no drink ever yet went to your head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir! I’m proud of it, demme,” said his lordship.
“I have drunk up a fortune, and where is it?—It’s
gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Distill your breath and get it back,” suggested
Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that? Demme, you are laughing at me,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never!” said Adam, decisively. “Above all persons
you make me sober. Breathe toward our friend
the Viscount. He has ever wished fortune to wing in
his direction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Viscount? Where? Demme, yes. My dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>old chap, how are you?” and turning, inconsequently,
to a friend whose little eyes seemed to swim around in
the florid sea of his face, his lordship was deserted by
the rover. Sauntering through a cluster of friends who
would have detained him, Adam approached a window,
where he sat himself down on a miniature divan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here he had but a second to himself, for while somebody
else was preparing to sing to the company, a
beautiful little lady, with eyes that were fairly purple
in their depths of blue, came and took the seat beside
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Rust,” she said, “what a strange song
that was. Why, but you know nothing of wine and
sack, and poison. Oh, why did you say poison? That
was dreadful. And why should you wish never to
think of love? What has poor little love ever done to
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must remember, Lady Violet,” said Adam,
“that before I sang I had not seen you, to speak a
word, during the entire evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Violet blushed. “That hasn’t anything to do
with anything,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam replied: “That makes me equivalent to
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t,” the lady protested. “You mix me all
up. I don’t believe you know anything more about
love than you do about drinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you counsel me to learn of these arts?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not of drinking—certainly not, Mr. Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we eliminate the drinking, that only leaves the
love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but I—I didn’t say that I—I don’t wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>counsel you at all. You twist about everything I
say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you twist about every man you meet,” retorted
Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do not!” she objected. “How rude you are
to say so. I don’t even like all the men I meet, and if
I did——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean, then, that you twist only the ones like
myself, that you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t! I——You make me say things I don’t
want to say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I shall make you say that you love me desperately,”
said Adam, complacently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rust!” she gasped. “I—I—I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are going to say it now, let me know,” Adam
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was blushing furiously. She did love him, just
about as Rust had described, but he had never guessed
it and was merely toying with the one absorbing and
universal topic of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I am not going to say anything of the kind!”
she stammered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then that proves my case,” Adam announced,
judicially. “I cannot compel you to say anything at
all that is not already at the point of your tongue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you are very rude,” she said, helplessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I have been told by Lady Margaret,” Adam
confessed. “Here she is herself. Lady Margaret, we
are having quite a discussion. Tell us, if a man tries
to make a lady say she loves him desperately, is he necessarily
rude?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A superb young widow, who was gradually emerging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>from her mourning black, and who had come to the
gathering with her father, halted in front of the two
on the small divan and looked them over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Lady Violet,” said the new comer, “your
brother and Lord Kilkrankie are looking for you everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you, so much,” said the confused little
lady, and without waiting for anything further she
jumped up and fled from the scene. She was vexed at
and distrustful of Lady Margaret; but she could not
remain and give her battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second lady took Violet’s seat, calmly. “What
have you been saying of love to that little, brainless
child?” she said. “You haven’t been making love to
her, surely?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no,” said Adam, “I was occupying my time
till you should come along and make love to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wretch,” she said, with perfect calm. “You
wouldn’t know love if you saw it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it so rare at Court?” he inquired. “Perhaps I
should spend my time better in looking at you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be silly,” she said. “But tell me, what is
your opinion, really, of love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It makes a poor fare for dinner, a poor coat in
the winter, and a poor comfort when you are dead,”
said Rust. “It tricks the clever; it’s the wandering
Jew of emotions. If you wish me to do you an injury,
bid me to love you forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where have you learned, that you speak with such
wisdom?” said Lady Margaret. “Surely not such a
child as Violet——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do yourself an injustice,” Adam interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>“Adam,” she said, “this is the sort of thing you
say to all the women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And which of your friends would you ask me to
neglect?” he asked. “A woman’s judgment is the
one thing I lack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a heartless wretch!” she announced.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the contrary, I am a wretch of a thousand
hearts,” he corrected. “How long would you continue
to love me if I had any less?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam! I don’t love you, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That leaves a vacancy in my life which I shall fill
at once,” he told her. “Wait—perhaps I can catch
the eye of the Countess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Countess had one of the most catchable eyes
imaginable. She came up immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Margaret says she no longer loves me,” said the incorrigible
Rust, “I shall give her place to you.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Sick</span> of the women, to all of whom he made love,
openly, to avoid being thought serious by any; weary
of the specious show, which failed to bring him the
forgetfulness he craved, Adam left the assemblage
early and went to search out the beef-eaters, at their
humble quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Improvidents that they were, Pike and Halberd had
soon dispersed the not inconsiderable sum of money
which Adam had divided between them, since which
time he had provided the pair with their lodgings, keep,
clothing and amusements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night being fine and the air soon reviving the
rover’s livelier moods of delight in sheer existence, he
found himself loitering along, stopping to look in the
windows of the scattered shops still open for the tag-ends
of the day’s trading. It was only the little knick-knack
shops, old curio dens and lesser establishments
that still had their lights aglow, but it happened that
these were the particular ones in which Adam took an
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped before one of the dingiest for fifteen
minutes, carefully scanning a considerable collection
of violins which the window contained. At length his
eye lighted, he muttered something half exclamatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and went into the shop at once. The dealer knew him
and nodded delightedly, glad to have him again in his
place, as he had fully expected when he placed the
rare old fiddle which Rust had seen, in his window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam bought the instrument with all the eagerness
of the confirmed connoisseur and went his way contented.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he came to the tavern where the beef-eaters
made their abode, he found little Pike dangerously ill
with pleurisy and thinking of shuffling off forlornly
into his next existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one thing which alone could transform Adam
Rust into the cheerful fellow he had been before his
veneer of cynicism came upon him, was illness in his
family. He refused to let his beef-eaters think of dying.
They were his tie to everything he still held dear.</p>

<p class='c007'>He pulled off his coat and went to work on Pike,
whose spirits he raised with songs, raillery and cheer,
and whose fever he lowered with teas and bitter drinks,
which he steeped himself, from various herbs and roots,
the specific qualities of which he had known from the
Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court saw no more of the reckless Adam for a
week. At the end of this time he had coaxed the faithful
Pike to something like his former health again,
when he announced his intention of going to Spain, to
add to his growing collection of violins. He therefore
said good-by to Sir William Phipps and went off with
his beef-eaters both in charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having learned that the Pyrenees afforded splendid
possibilities for building up depleted health and
strength, the rover domiciled himself and companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>in a spot that was charmingly lonely. And William
Phipps, when Adam’s first letter arrived, wondered
vaguely what manner of violins his comrade was finding
in the mountains.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>FOILED PURPOSES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Increase Mather</span> met with a dignified and polite
reception at the Court of the King, for Sir William
Phipps, with all his influence and persuasiveness, prepared
the way for the envoy extraordinary to approach
the master of the colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William even constituted himself another champion
of downtrodden Massachusetts, and added his
importunities to those of Mather, to induce James to
re-establish the rights and territory of the colony and
to give it back its beloved charter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We love you much, Sir William,” said the King,
with a firmness which was never to be shaken, “but
we cannot accede to your wishes. Anything but this
that you will ask shall be granted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Disappointed, but never disconcerted, Sir William
conferred with Mather, whom he was obliged to assure
that nothing that either of them could say to him now
would beget an alteration of King James’s decision.
Mather, persistent, suave and convinced of the justice
of his cause, determined to remain in touch with the
Court and the King’s retainers, until sheer patience
and persistence should win what persuasion could not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps, knowing only too well the disposition of the
King, when once his word was passed, determined that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>he could do more for his country if present in the
colony than he could by remaining in London. Reminding
the King that he had already granted him any
other favor than the restoration of the colony’s charter,
he announced his desire to be appointed Sheriff of
New England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regretting to lose the hearty Captain from his company,
James nevertheless kept his word by complying
with Sir William’s request. The appointment was duly
made and confirmed. Leaving Mather behind him,
Phipps returned to Boston and set about the administration
of his new-made duties, with more ardor
than cunning, with more honesty than diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is doubtful if William Phipps ever had a more
aggravating experience, in all his adventures, with
mutineers and pirates, than he underwent at the hands
of Randolph and Governor Andros. He was not a man
of finished education. Born in Maine, in a family of
twenty-one children, he had been obliged to commence
the round of shifting for himself at an early age. He
had apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter at eighteen
and then had come to Boston four years later, when he
went to work and taught himself to read and to write.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hampered now, by this lack of early opportunities,
insulted, and finding his most sincere efforts nullified
and his plans constantly frustrated, by the delays and
artifices of the council under Andros, he was made
heartily sick of the whole situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>His return to Boston, however, was not marked entirely
by chagrin and discouragement. He had his
wife with him, and herein lay the greatest happiness
which ever came into his eventful life. He built her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the “fair brick house, in the Green Lane,” which he
had promised, years before, and he endeared many of
the staunch patriots, who beheld his efforts to help
them, sadly, though with admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Garde had never known how very intimate
indeed had been the relations of Captain Phipps and
Adam, yet she was aware that they had been much
together. She had naturally learned, in common with
all the inhabitants of Boston, that Sir William had
found the treasure he had spent so many years in seeking,
but she had never known that when she sent Adam
away he had gone to Hispaniola to join the searching
expedition. Therefore she was in ignorance of the fact
that Adam was wealthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, after all, she was only concerned with Adam’s
present whereabouts, and the reasons why, after all
these months and months of waiting—it being now two
full years since that last tragic meeting—he had never
relented sufficiently to write, or to send her a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>As time had gone on, she had become more and more
convinced, either that Adam intended never to forgive
her, or that he had married some one else and therefore
could not, in honor, think longer upon her. Her belief
inclined toward the first explanation. She confessed
that she had done him a great wrong, especially
as she had never even so much as permitted him to
deny the story of the Indian child, but she argued that
had she been in his place and forgiveness had been so
earnestly implored, she could not have had the heart to
refuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the one little sad privilege left her, to make
up her mind she would wait, till death, if need be,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>patiently, lovingly, till Adam should one day know she
loved him and that she was keeping herself sacred for
his claiming. And if he never did come to claim her,
still she would love him. If death came to take her,
she would go to death as a bride would go to church,
to wait the coming of her love.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the frame of mind which her vigil had begotten,
fortified by her sense of maidenly pride and diffidence,
it was utterly impossible for her to think of going
either to Sir William Phipps, or to his wife, to ask for
information concerning Adam. She was aware that
the Captain doubtless knew of Adam’s whereabouts,
his position in life and whether or not he was married,
but if Adam chose to remain silent, disdainful and unforgiving,
she would rather die than go to a stranger to
ask about him, or to send him anything further, in the
way of a word or a letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, Garde had attempted to send
another little letter, a year after the first one had gone,
but it too had fallen into the clutches of Randolph.
The creature had destroyed it, as containing nothing
of importance to any of his machinations, for it merely
asked the rover if he had received the first epistle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Garde’s golden opportunity slipped away unused,
and her life narrowed down, more and more, to
the simple duties of taking what care she could of the
white-haired old man, her grandfather, who rubbed his
thumb across the ends of his fingers endlessly, although
he was slowly being restored to his old-time activity of
mind and body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Utterly disheartened, by the futility of his desires
and efforts to serve his country in his capacity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Sheriff, Sir William Phipps was glad to receive a letter
that came from Increase Mather, informing him that
the time was drawing near for renewed labors to be
attempted in England. Responding to this, he deserted
his useless office and sailed for London in the
midst of the winter season.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opportunity of which Garde might have availed
herself, to learn something of Adam, was gone. She
knew not what she had done, or what she had lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps came to England at a moment when epochs
were fairly in the process of crystalization.</p>

<p class='c007'>King James, the last of Britain’s Roman Catholic
monarchs, had been obliged to abdicate his throne and
to flee to Ireland for his life.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>MAKING HISTORY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Unthroned</span> and uncrowned as he was, James, for
some inexplicable reason, still entertained a wild idea
that the colonies, the patriots of which he had taken
no pains to endear to his cause or himself, would still
remain loyal and contented to acquiesce in his dominion.
He made all haste to communicate with Sir William
Phipps, as a representative of New England whom he
had always honored and esteemed. He offered to appoint
the Captain his Governor of all New England,
with plenary powers, in almost any direction, concerning
the old charter and all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Promptly and with the blunt wisdom which marked
his course through life, Phipps refused the honor.
Catholicism had never appealed to his sense of good
government, and loyalty to the English throne, from
which the colonies had their being, was deeply ingrained
in his nature. Gratitude to James for past favors, to
which he felt he was somewhat entitled, was a large
quality in Sir William, but between gratitude and folly
he drew a sturdy line.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Increase Mather, Phipps went to work at once
at the Court of William of Orange, who with Mary ascended
the British throne early in 1689. Intelligence
as to the sinister machinations of Randolph and Andros
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>leaked through the censorship, and came to Mather
and the Captain. Their case was strengthened. The
Prince of Orange was bound, by all the faith of his
Protestant principles, to grant what release he might to
the American colonies from the oppressors placed in
power by the Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new King’s declaration of his sway was conveyed
in haste to the American shores. It was taken overland
from Virginia to Massachusetts. The spirit of
the Puritans, which had simmered so long, began to
make the sounds of boiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andros, mighty in his sovereignty, arrested the messenger
who had fetched the news, but the news had
leaped from lip to lip, and the torch had been applied
to combustible thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, John Winslow confirmed the declaration
of the new monarchs. The people now gathered together
their all-but-forgotten muskets and pikes.
Against the flood-tide coming toward him, Governor
Andros reared a barricade of threats. The frigate
“Rose” was lying in the harbor, bristling with guns
that showed like so many sinister, black fangs. Her
decks were alive with soldiers. The Governor demanded
the submission and disarmament of the people,
on pain of death. He declared his intention of employing
the cannon and arsenal of the frigate forthwith,
if the angry disturbances did not immediately cease.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 18th of April the patriots were prepared with
their answer. The captain of the frigate, with nearly
all of his officers, had come ashore, to hold a conference
with Andros and Randolph. The Puritans suddenly
swooped down upon them and captured every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Jack of the lot. The frigate was thus put out of
action at one clever stroke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now rolled the alarm of beaten drums through the
martial city of Boston. In their old Indian-fighting
regalia, the citizens swarmed from their houses into
the streets. They set up their ensign on Beacon Hill,
at the edge of the Common, they fired a signal gun for
action, and falling upon Randolph and many of the
council, which Andros had collected about him, they
rushed them to jail and took possession of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proclamation of King William was read, with
loud acclaim. The excited populace surged in the
narrow, crooked highways. The leaders demanded of
Andros that he surrender both his office and himself.
The man refused and fled to his stronghold, whence he
defied the patriots and continued to the last to declare
his power, though like water now fast escaping from
his grasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surrounding their ex-master they made him a prisoner,
not a refugee, and at length he gave in and was
captured and sent to confinement, along with the
others of his recent government.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an instinct for conventions, the citizens were
soon assembled. Howsoever great had been their heat
in their moment of rebellion and triumph, they were
calm enough to be wise when the time arrived to declare
for themselves. They reinstated Bradstreet and the
Council of ’86. They declared the old Government in
force and their former charter <i>ipso facto</i> restored,
unimpaired by the interim of nearly three years of maladministration.</p>

<p class='c007'>William and Mary received the report of all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>swiftly terminated proceedings with a favor which was
not unblended with astonishment. Admiring the
Protestant spirit, which it had become their own
special province to uphold, they lost no time in confirming
the entire course of actions, even to the temporary
resumption of their old charter privileges and
powers, by the patriots across the sea. And there, for
a time, they were contented to permit the matter to
rest. The affairs of England they had found so completely
engrossing that they had no time to spare toward
regranting a specific charter to Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Increase Mather, suspicions of privileges and liberties
not absolutely signed, sealed and delivered, remained
at his post, working continuously and sedulously to
obtain that monarchical support and confirmation of
the colony’s prerogatives which his many compatriots
had sent him to secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William Phipps, on the other hand, realized the
busy state of mind in which William and Mary had
been so abruptly plunged, and he therefore deferred
further work with Mather for a time more suitable.
Then, when he learned that the French Catholics in
America had formed alliances with the Indians and
were already overrunning the Protestant territory and
committing daily depredations, he made up his mind
once more to return to the field of action, in which he
might be able to render more effective service than he
could by remaining in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arrived in the summer of that fateful year, ’89,
and offered himself to Bradstreet at once. The period
of warfare in which he thereupon engaged was one of
great length and of much bitterness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Alternating defeat and victory left the advantages
with the French and Indians, so far as hopes of ultimate
success were concerned. The colonists had to make
such long, tedious marches that decisive victories for
their arms were almost impossible. The enemy gained
in confidence, audacity and numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In despair the General Court finally offered two
sloops of war, free, together with all the profits of
plunder which might result from the enterprise, to
any man who would undertake to reduce to ashes
Penobscot, St. John’s and Port Royal, the seats of the
French and Indian power. The offer attracted Phipps,
who foresaw, in the execution of the task, an infinite
amount of adventure and action.</p>

<p class='c007'>He enlisted men for the undertaking. Yet matters
grew worse with such alarming rapidity that before the
enterprise could be placed in readiness for work, it became
necessary to raise a small fleet of vessels prepared
for war-like operations. Thus seven sloops and seven
hundred men, under command of Sir William, sailed
away to the North on their sinister errand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Port Royal, secure and arrogant, in her fancied isolation
from attack, was surprised and taken. The
French were routed with great loss. The town was
looted until hardly so much as a sauce-pan was left by
the thorough-going warriors of New England. The
plunder, while not enormously valuable, nevertheless
was sufficient to help materially in meeting the expenses
of the venture. But its indirect effect on the colonists
was not so happy. Cupidity is so often the jackal that
follows righteous indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Puritans foresaw opportunities to punish the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>enemy, at the enemy’s own expense. A second expedition,
to go against Quebec, was planned, the patriots
expecting in confidence that, like the first, it would
surely succeed, if Phipps were at its head, and that the
plunder would more than repay the initial expenses of
the expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William, having expressed his doubts of the wisdom
of this over-ambitious scheme, nevertheless commanded
the fleet once more as it sailed away, eager for
further conquest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enterprise was doomed to failure from the first.
It dragged out interminably, it developed jealousies, it
was ill-planned. Such a bedraggled, failure-smitten
lot of lame-duck sloops returned to Boston that the
council were simply appalled. They had expended so
much of their meager hoard of funds on the venture,
that the treasury was practically bankrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blame rained upon the head of Phipps, for not having
succeeded against impossible conditions. Driven
to extremities, by the woeful lack of plunder, the colony-fathers
were obliged, for the first time in their
history, to issue paper currency. The notes ranged in
value from denominations of two shillings up to ten
pounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still an undimmed patriot, ready to serve his country
in whatsoever direction an opportunity was afforded,
Williams Phipps gave his gold for the colony’s bills,
absorbing thus a very considerable sum. His example
induced investments in the paper from all directions.
Nevertheless the currency soon came tumbling down in
value, till a pound in paper was worth less than three-fourths
of its face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>The sailors, and other working people, lost heavily,
in these times of trouble and weakened confidence.
Yet eventually the money was all redeemed at par by
the Massachusetts government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William, weary of being reviled for his pains, returned
to England once again and resumed his labors
with Increase Mather, to secure to the colony a definite
charter.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Adam Rust</span> failed, even in the intricacies of collecting
violins and the pursuit of health for the old beef-eaters,
to find the depths of forgetfulness she sought,
but which could not come to a nature such as his had
always been. Indeed seclusion, away from the gaiety
of Court and his fellow-beings seemed rather to develop
the old, half-forgotten memories in his brain, whereon
had once been shadowed the sufferings of King Philip,
his Indian foster-father, and all his race of hunted
people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beef-eaters, also, were not absolutely contented,
away from their own country and the haunts wherein
they were wont to brag, to drink and to swagger.
Yielding at last to their importunities, Adam returned
with the pair to London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once in the foggy capital again, he was soon pounced
upon, by old associates, with whom he found it exhilarating
once again to consort. A treatise on rare violins
and their makers, over which he had labored and
pondered for months, or even years, was now neglected.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sharpened his wits, had a look at his sword and
brightened up his disused tinsel of conversation. He
soon began to believe the greatest forgetfulness, after
all, is where the Babel of tongues is loudest, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the most absolute solitude is to be found in the midst
of the largest throng.</p>

<p class='c007'>The social functions of the new King were fewer, less
brilliant and not to be compared, in point of popularity,
with those of James. The Dukes, the Marchionesses
and lesser lights were therefore constrained to make the
more of their private parties. There was, in consequence,
no stint of hunting, drinking and dancing—all
as condiments poured about the omniprevalent piece de
resistance—making love.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Duchess of Kindlen’s, Adam found the set he
had known particularly well. He was welcomed back to
their circle as a long-lost fixture without whose presence
no one was at all able to explain how they had managed
to go on existing. They fitted him back in his niche
with a promptness which might have been flattering, had
he not been aware that they wished merely to feed upon
him as a new entertainer, or an old one refurbished.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not surprised to learn that Lady Violet had
been married in his absence. He was duly informed
of this event, which he described as an irreparable
calamity in his life, by Lady Margaret, who was more
of a brilliant blossom of feminine charm and enticements
than even before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you, my dear Lady Margaret,” he said, “you
have been true to my memory? You have never learned
to love another?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never learned to love you, Adam,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it must have been a matter of spontaneous
combustion,” he concluded. “You always did manage
your compliments adroitly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confirmed villain,” she answered, “a woman would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>be mad who loved such a bubble of flattering reflections
as you have always been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was not accusing you of sanity,” he told her
frankly. “I was merely inquiring whether or not you
have learned to love somebody else, in my absence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I had, what then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should wish to pause for reflection, before determining
whether I should be more sorry for the other
fellow or for myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fiend!” she said, mildly, “you shall never know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Know what?—know where to place my sympathy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall never know whether I have learned to
love another, or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, neither will you—that one’s consolation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But at least I shall know how I feel toward you,
Adam Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So shall I,” said the cheerful Adam. “I have
always known. If you should say you were dying, I
should know you were dying to run away with me,
forthwith. It’s not your fault, you can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never dreamed of such a thing in my life!” she
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you ought at once to consult a physician for
a bad case of insomnia. I thought your eyes looked a
bit weary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You vile thing!” she answered. “Ted never said
such a thing as that in his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you have been trying to learn to love Ted?
I thought you had a faithless look about you—all except
about your eyes. Alas, from the way you talk I
know you must be married already to this Ted.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“I’m not!” she said, unguardedly. “I refused only
to-night to set the day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was a thoughtfulness toward me I had not expected,”
said Rust, complacently. “But you are betrothed,
and this was unkind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unkind to whom?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Ted—and to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will like Ted,” she told him, more artfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the other end of a duel, yes—immensely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a terrible swordsman,” she said, to urge him
on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet how poorly he fenced with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won. You got him—poor devil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wretch! Ted at least would never pick on a
woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it’s Ted Suffle,” said Rust, “I saw him pick on
his teeth, to-night, and that is worse——in company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“His tooth aches terribly!” said Lady Margaret,
defending poor Suffle gallantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He indulges in too much sweets,” Adam remarked,
unmoved. “Treat him the way you do me and he’ll
soon be better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish Ted could hear the way you talk to me,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he could hear the things you say to me, he would
demand that duel quicker,” Rust responded. “Tell
me something outrageous to say to the fellow, so that
he will be obliged to challenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense,” she said, looking at him slyly, “don’t
be silly. You wouldn’t fight a duel over me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, but think what a lot of ladies would think me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>a hero,” he replied with enthusiasm. “And I might
also be banished from the country. You can never tell
where luck and lightning will strike next.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go away, Adam,” she said. “You are perfectly
monstrous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go and have a look at Ted,” he answered,
calmly. “If he is a gentleman he will probably insult
me without delay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To Lady Margaret’s utter dismay and astonishment,
he sauntered off at once and actually went to where
Suffle was standing, and had himself presented.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have asked for this honor,” he said, “the sooner
to offer my best congratulations on your betrothal.
Lady Margaret has told me a little about it. She is
the happiest girl I have ever seen in all my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a good chap to say so,” said Suffle. “Do
you know, I fancied I should like you, Mr. Rust, the
moment I saw you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like to give you my friendship as a wedding
present,” Adam told him, honestly, knowing at
once that Suffle was a fellow he could really somewhat
like. Then he added, more equivocally: “I have
known Lady Margaret so long that I shall take great
happiness in seeing the consummation of this happy
event.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>JUGGLING WITH FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Lady Margaret</span> was a beautiful woman. The next
time he met her, Adam realized that this was true.
He stood looking down upon her, where she sat on a
low divan which was made to throw two persons very
close together, and into which he had avoided squeezing.
The young woman looked up at him winningly,
a slumberous passion in her garnet-brown eyes. Her
creamy white bosom rose and fell in a calm voluptuousness,
the twin beauties of which were more than suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust could not recall that he had ever seen shoulders
more superb, nor a throat more delightfully round and
built upward in curves to the perfect chin at the top.
In contrast with her lustrously dark eyes and her almost
black eyebrows, spanning her forehead with their
dainty arches, her old-gold hair was an amazing crown
of loveliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had led him away from the company, “to look
for Ted,” with an art which had for once deceived the
crafty rover completely. Now, as he looked upon her,
assuming a coldness it was utterly impossible to feel,
and be a man, he noted a beauty in her bare arms
which made him think of the perfect lines of a tiger’s
paw. He could have suggested nothing to make them
more splendid.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Indeed she was well-nigh matchless as a creation of
nature and polite society. Her shimmering satin
gown clung to her form as if ardently. Her pretty
gold-slippered feet and her slender ankles, in red
silk, open-work stockings, defied a glance to ignore
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” she said, smiling up at him archly, “I
wish you were a girl—just for a few moments, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would suffer by the contrast between us,”
said Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would know what a—what a bore he is,” she
went on, regardless of his comment. “And it would
serve you right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You doubtless mean the King,” he replied.
“Your expedients are cruel. Make anything out of
me—a camel, if you like,—but not a girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean Ted,” she said, a little desperately. “You
know I mean Ted. You know what a bore he is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you have spoiled him since morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have no right to be the only man who isn’t a
bore,” she went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll be telling me I am the only man you ever
loved, in a moment,” he answered. “I can feel it
coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I did,” she said with a passionate glance,
“what then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was frightened, as he had never been before in
his life. He took out his handkerchief and flecked a
bit of dust from his boot, nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should advise you to be bled for fever,” he
said. “And I should know the old affection you had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>for me once had departed forever. Couldn’t you break
my heart in some simpler way, dear Lady Margaret?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was all your fault for going away,” she told him.
“You knew I liked you before you went away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes,” he responded gaily, “but I saw that your
passionate love for me was waning, so I went away to
kindle it over again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do be serious for a moment,” she murmured, vexed
with his calmness and his raillery. “You know Ted
is a dreadful bore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then since you have given him the love that once
was mine, my cue is to become a bore instanter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would never know it, if I loved you madly,”
she said, looking up into his face with her declaration
centered in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I would,” he corrected, placidly. “If you
loved me madly you would tell me about it; you know
you would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her breath came fast. Her bosom rose and fell
rapidly. “You wouldn’t believe me if I did,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you told me you loved me madly,” said Adam,
“I should know you didn’t. So please let me go on
with my fond delusions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was silent a moment. He could feel her burning
gaze on his face. “Adam,” she said presently,
“do sit down.” She moved to make half room enough
for him on the divan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, and make you stand?” he replied.
“Never!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She placed her hand on the arm of the seat, where
she knew his fingers would return when he had finished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>scratching at a tiny white speck on his coat-lappel.
He observed her motion and thrust his fist in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am dying,” she presently whispered, after
another silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How interesting,” Adam cheerfully commented.
“What are you dying for, a glass of water, or a new
set of diamonds?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what I am dying for,” she said, tremulously,
in a voice hardly above a whisper. “You said
if I were dying, you—you would know what for.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, did I?” Adam mused. He was pale behind
his calm. His hands were perspiring, coldly. “Yes,
of course. I said you would be dying to run away
with me. And now you would try to prove that this
was all wrong. My dear Lady Margaret, this is unkind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She arose from her seat. She was driven to her wits’
end for anything to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silly boy,” she answered, as she came toward him,
and then she quickly added: “Oh, Adam, would you
mind just clasping this strap?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The strap was a narrow bit of finery which crossed
her bare shoulder. She had artfully loosened the golden
clasp and now came to present shoulder, strap, clasp
and all for re-arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is nothing I can do with greater ease,” said
Rust, “There you are,—done already.” He had performed
his office with amazing dexterity and with a
touch so fleeting that she would never have known
when it alighted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you haven’t done it right, my dear foolish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Adam,” she said, with a delicious little chuckle. “I’ll
put my arm across your shoulder, so. Now, make it
right, do, Adam, please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dropped her exquisite arm on his shoulder as she
spoke and edged closer. She turned so that her face
was so near to his that he could feel how glowing warm
she was. Her breath fanned against his cheek, hotly.
The man felt a sense of intoxication stealing upon him.
Yet he was fixing the clasp as briefly as before, when
she made a movement with her slipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am falling,” she said in a little cry, and
throwing both arms about him, to support herself, she
was clasped close to his breast, for a moment, before he
could seem to re-establish her balance. In that brief
time a mad horde of thoughts ran riotously through his
brain. She was beautiful; she loved him; she had
fascinated something in him always. Could he not be
happy, loving her and having her love in return? Why
not run away with her—to the Continent—anywhere—and
fill the aching void in his nature with love and
caresses!</p>

<p class='c007'>His heart was beating furiously. He trembled. A
fever leaped into his brain. Through his arms shot a
galvanic contraction, as they halted in the act of closing
about the superb, slender figure he was holding. It
seemed as if he must kiss her, on her lips, her throat—her
shoulder!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam, I am dying!” she whispered to him again,
as he held her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t die standing up,” he said, with a sudden recovery
of the mastery over himself. “Sit down and
do it calmly.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>He swayed her aside, and there was nothing she could
do but to take the seat she had occupied before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How provoking of me to trip on my gown,” she
said, looking up at him sullenly. “Do you think we
shall have snow to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall pray against a precipitation of icebergs,” said
Adam. “There is nothing suggestive of love in ice.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A BEEF-EATER PASSES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> rigors of the London winter pursued the beef-eaters
relentlessly, tapping them remindfully on the
shoulder, now and again, with a cold, or a spell of
bronchitis, and then, under cover of a fog, some deadly
affliction fastened upon the pair all at once. The rover
found them, after an absence from their quarters of
two days, so ill that first one and then the other was
crawling from his bed to minister to his comrade, so
that both grew rapidly worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam looked at the two of them ruefully, when at
length he came to where they were. He had never
known them ill in this manner before. They cared
nothing for eating; they slept but little. Their eyes
were bright. They were perfectly cheerful, in a feeble
sort of way. After the Sachem had come they declared
they wanted for nothing, provided he would talk to
them, sing a little and let them lie there and see him,
or hear him play on his favorite violin.</p>

<p class='c007'>He brought them every comfort which money could
buy. He cooked for them, served them and ate at their
board—which was a board indeed, reaching from one
bed to the other, where they could easily get at what he
spread on its surface for their pleasure. But the choice
wines he fetched, and the fruits and the delicate bits of
game and fish, remained almost wholly untasted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Adam was soon at a loss to know what to do. He
tried to get at their symptoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pike, you rogue,” he said, “I want to know where
you feel bad. You are ill, you know; now where is the
pain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my sword-stroke,” said Pike, in a worn-down
voice, “I have no pain. I may be tired, to-day, but to-morrow,
bring me a pirate and I shall eat him without
the trouble of slicing him first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tired, that’s it,” agreed Halberd. “I’m a bit tired
myself, this afternoon, but by cock’s crow to-morrow I
could enjoy pulling the tail out of a lion and beating
the beast to death with the bloody end of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, doesn’t your stomach ache, or your head
hurt you?” insisted Adam. “When you cough like
that, doesn’t it hurt your chest?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I like it, for the tickling,” said Halberd.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two old scamps were afraid of being taken across
the channel to Spain again, or down into France, or
perhaps across to Morocco. After three days of his
“tinkering” unsuccessfully, with his faithful companions,
Adam called in a doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The worthy physician promptly bled the two patients.
Little Pike became quieter, if possible, than before.
Halberd, on the contrary, was somewhat wrought up in
his feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my steel!” said he, when the doctor had departed,
“this puny Sir Nostrum has let more of my
juice with his nonsense than ever was taken by swordsman
out of my carcass. Faith! I’ll pulp the fellow,
and he comes again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam laughed, for Halberd suddenly got back a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>monstrous appetite. He likewise abounded in pains,
which he permitted the Sachem to soothe; and he
otherwise improved past all belief. He had been a little
ill, and his sympathy with Pike had made his ailment
mischievous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pike, however, had no such rally in him. He put in
his time smoothing the coverlet with slow, feeble movements,
while he lay there looking at Adam with dumb
affection until one could almost fancy he was wagging
a tail, with weak, joyful jerks.</p>

<p class='c007'>He got the Sachem to sing him the love song of the
many seas, for Pike had once had a heart full of love
for a maiden himself, and while the experience was
nothing jollier than a funeral on the day set for the
wedding, nevertheless he liked the lively song, with all
its various maids and misses mentioned, for he conceived
them all to be the self-same girl, after all,
simply transported to different climes.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Adam was singing and playing, with the merriest
spirit he could conjure, the wistful old Pike had
the impudence to close his eyes and die.</p>

<p class='c007'>A faint smile lingered on his face; whether as a result
of his joke on Adam and Halberd, or his pleasure
derived from the song, could never be known.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A WOMAN SCORNED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Sir William Phipps</span> and Increase Mather, together
with the other Puritan patriots who made up the small
band of charter-hunters at the Court of William and
Mary, worked consistently, if not harmoniously, toward
their end.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found their monarch disposed to permit them
to do about as they pleased, when at length he comprehended
their situation and the needs of Massachusetts.
His attorney-general was ordered to draw
up a charter, on the broad lines suggested by the
American council. No sooner did they get it into
their hands, however, than they fell into heated discussions
over trifling divergencies which they found between
it and the older charter, which they had come
to regard with almost idolatrous awe and reverence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new charter granted them many liberties and
privileges which the old one had not contained. Time
even proved the new one to be the better document for
the colony, but despite these facts, and the further fact
that it restored to their dominion the provinces of
Maine, New Hampshire, and Nova Scotia, to the St.
Lawrence River, they found much at which to grumble.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, they finally accepted what they had, with
what show of gratitude they were able to simulate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Their disaffection doubtless had its purpose, and it
might have been fruitful of the further concession
which they gained, namely, the privilege of nominating
their own next Governor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, for once, they were quite unanimous. They
requested that Sir William Phipps be appointed. They
knew that without the priceless services which he had
rendered the cause, during all his sojourn in England,
they might never have received a tithe of what was
now secured to their country with all possible stability.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nomination of Captain Phipps was made complete
by the King without delay. He was constituted
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Province
of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, and
likewise Captain-General of the Colonies of Connecticut
and Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weighted down with these new responsibilities, he
went seeking for Adam Rust, at the gay salon of the
Duchess of Kindlen, noted in its day for its scope and
the liberties acceded to the guests who assembled in
its spacious halls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard from a mutual friend that Sir William
would be looking him up at the Duchess’, Adam repaired
to the scene rather more early than was his
custom. He had seen but little of the captain for a
matter of several years. He was chiding himself upon
the negligence by which this had been made possible,
when he arrived at the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The funeral of the faithful Pike, and the plight of
the lorn old Halberd, since losing his comrade, had
depressed Adam’s spirits immeasurably. Halberd had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>been following him about, dumbly, ever since the
dire event in the family. He said but little; he made
no complaints of his loneliness. He simply hung on
Adam’s footsteps, like a homeless old dog, whose one
remaining instinct is faithfulness and undying affection,
waiting for his master when he came from the brightly-lighted
houses, pleased and excited whenever he could
have the Sachem to talk with on the topic of Pike’s
many virtues and traits of character that confirmed
him in his fellow’s affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had taken the lorn beef-eater into his own
apartments, where he could keep a more careful watch
over his health and his negative happiness. No friend
among all his noble acquaintances had such a hold on
Adam’s heart as had this bragging old remnant of his
retinue, and to none did he drop the mask of frivolity
as he did before this companion, whom nothing could
discourage nor alter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus he had been glad to think of going no more
where the Duchess, Lady Margaret and the others
assembled, with their tinsel show, their thinly-plated
talk, their gambling and amours, but had contemplated
going away with Halberd, into Nature’s simpler walks
and profounder beauties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The garish glitter struck inharmoniously upon him,
as he walked impatiently through the brilliant rooms,
in a search for Sir William Phipps, who had not yet
arrived. He presently found himself confronted by
Suffle, who, in turn, had been looking about for Lady
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do?” said Suffle, at once. “My dear
Rust, I am charmed to see you again. I have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>wanting to see you, ’pon my word. Would you mind
just giving me a few minutes’ talk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of my greatest delights is derived from listening
to a brilliant conversationalist,” said Rust. “Where
shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no one as yet in the dice-box,” said the
other. “If you don’t mind, we might stroll in there
by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saying, “I am yours to command,” Adam followed
leisurely behind his friend to the now empty room employed
nightly for gambling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s rather a delicate business—what I have to say,”
confessed Suffle, by way of a preface, “but you are a
frank, decent fellow, that a man can talk to, well—openly—don’t
you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” said Adam. “If it is anything about
Lady Margaret, let us be sensible, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s devilish clever of you, old chap,” responded
Suffle, evidently much relieved already. “Of course
you know how matters stand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would never be sure of where anything stood,
that had a woman for an element in its make-up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know. That’s clever, too—deucedly clever.
Perhaps I had better put it plainly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do, I beg of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now—you are a frank, sensible man. Now—do
you really like—you know—love, you know—Lady
Margaret,—just speaking as man to man, sensibly, as
you so cleverly said?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you force me to become either ungallant or
a traitor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all, I——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“Well, let us say that I am ungallant, since we are
to be frank,” said Rust. “I will even admit that I am
ungallant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good,” said Suffle. “That’s what I thought—I
mean, you know——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know what you mean. Proceed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I feel very much relieved. You are a decent
sort, Rust—a deucedly decent sort. Now I am very
fond of Lady Margaret. I have learned to be, you
know. My uncle requires me to marry her, don’t you
see, or be cut off with a brass farthing. So I have
learned to be deucedly fond of her, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very reasonable and like a man,” said Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I fancy so myself. I am coming to the
point.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then there is a point?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh dear me, yes. You see, as you don’t care for
Lady Margaret, that way, and I do——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why then, to be sure, take her and let me give
you my blessing,” Rust interrupted. “I will do this
with all my heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, old chap, but that is not quite the point,”
Suffle assured him. “The fact of the matter is, she
rather likes you, Rust, you know. I’m bound to admit
she does, though God knows why, and we are two
sensible men, you know, and that is what I wanted to
talk about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do me too great an honor,” Adam assured
him. “But what would you have me do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—that’s just the point. Of course I wouldn’t
like to ask you to clear out of the country——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t let modesty stand in your way, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>dear Suffle. This favor would be nothing—a mere
trifle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, now, I wouldn’t permit it,” said Suffle,
magnanimously. “But you are such a deucedly clever
fellow, don’t you know, that I thought you might be
able to devise something, something to—well, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, oh yes,” said Adam, pulling calmly at his long
golden mustache. He meditated for a moment and
idly picked up a dice-box, placed in readiness for the
evening’s play upon the table. “Do you ever fripper
away your time with these? If you do, perhaps we
might arrange a little harmless device without much
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At one of the doors, the figure of Lady Margaret
appeared and disappeared as Suffle expressed his eagerness
to know what the plan in Adam’s head might be.
Although she had glided swiftly from room to room in
search of Rust, Lady Margaret had frowned when she
saw him in company with her fiancé, and petulantly
beating her fan in her fragrant little palm, she had
gone back around toward a secondary entrance, in
which a heavy curtain hung. She was vaguely wondering
what the two could find to talk about together,
and to what extent they were gambling, that they went
at the dice thus early.</p>

<p class='c007'>She now met Sir William Phipps, Governor-elect of
New England, who had finally arrived and who was
scanning the gathering company for a sight of Adam
Rust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how well you are looking, Sir William,” she
cried to Phipps, delightedly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>“I am looking for a friend,” said the captain, with
his customary bluntness. “But thank you, Lady
Margaret, thank you, heartily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are looking for a friend, why, look over my
head?” she said to him, prettily. “Oh, you dear Colonial
Governors are such delightfully honest people.
We all have to like you, really.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have found some honest men in England,” said
the Captain, with conviction. “The Puritans are
growing numerous among your people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Margaret laughed, spontaneously enough.
“And what about our women?” she said. “Do you
find them at all—well, charming?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some are as bold as a pirate,” he said, without intending
anything personal. He could see many ropes
and clusters of jewels, gleaming from afar. “And
some of them must have plundered many a good ship
of her treasure,” he added. “If I don’t put about and
do some cruising, I shall never speak that boy to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed, somewhat jerkily, and sauntered off.
Lady Margaret continued on her way around toward
that curtained door, on the other side of which she had
seen Rust and Suffle with the dice.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Phipps spent no further time in conversing
with the women, beyond a word as he passed, so that
finally he came to the gambling apartment, where he
found his protégé. Knitting his brows for a second,
in an ill-concealed annoyance, to see Adam Rust engaged
in such a pursuit as this, he stood there in the
doorway, hoping to catch Adam’s eye and so to admonish
him silently for indulging even a moment’s
whim at this vice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>“One thousand more,” said Adam, somewhat hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William pricked up his ears in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost again!” Rust exclaimed. “The devil is in
the dice!” His back was toward the curtained door.
There was a mirror, however, directly across the room.
Watching the glass he presently beheld the reflection
of a movement, where the tapestry swayed behind
him. “Three thousand now, or nothing!” he added,
desperately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dice rattled out of the box in the silence that
followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s luck,” said Suffle, scooping up the dice to
throw again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s sorcery!” exclaimed the rover, in evident heat.
“Come, sir, I have two thousand left. I’ll stake it all
on a single throw!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps would have interfered, had it been in any
place but a private house, where the scandal would
spread so swiftly. He twitched in nervousness, as he
gripped the cane with which he would have liked to
knock the dice-box endways.</p>

<p class='c007'>The throw was completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m done!” said Rust. “I’ve nothing more to
stake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, come,” said Suffle, tauntingly, “play your
sword, your—surely you must have something you
prize. What, no resources? Must we cease the play
so soon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sword? No!” said Adam, with temper.
“But stay; since you speak so slightingly of my sword,
I have one more stake to offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By all means name it and play.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“My stake, sir, is the Lady Margaret,” Adam
growled at him, angrily. “Betrothed to you, she
loves me more. Come, sir, stake me a thousand
against my chances to win her and take her away from
you, heart and soul. A thousand, sir, and if you can
win it—your field shall be open, you shall hear nor
fear no more from me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my faith,” said Suffle, rising, as Adam had
done, “you hold this lady lightly, that you prattle of
her name like this. Better I should run you through,
for an arrant knave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah!” said Rust, “you think more of your winnings
than you do of your lady. You hesitate and
scold over a paltry thousand. Stake it, man, or by my
troth I shall tell her what valuation you put upon her
worth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Margaret’s face appeared for a second at the
curtain. It was white with rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You insult this lady with your monstrous proposition,”
cried Suffle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you insult her worse, with your parsimony!”
came the swift retort.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is calumny for you to say she loves you!”
Suffle growled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet stake me, sir, or you shall see me get her and
laugh at your stinginess,” Rust flung at him banteringly.
“Come, sir, one more moment and I withdraw
the offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Done!” said Suffle, “for by ’sdeath, my fortune
shall prove you a liar! Throw the dice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam threw and counted. “My luck has changed
at last,” he said, in triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>“We shall see,” retorted Suffle, and flinging the
dice he sat down and roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost!” said Adam, tragically. “So be it. To
the devil with you, sir; and I wish you joy of your
winnings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He strode from the table, met Sir William Phipps
at the door, winked at him merrily and so drew him
out in the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this? What’s this?” said the Governor,
excitedly. “I come here to see you, with news on my
tongue, and find you—like this!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tush, William,” said Adam, laughing boyishly,
and as cool as a fish. “I was betting in farthings. I
must have lost a hundred. Did you think the luck
was all with Suffle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, sir, this—this lady?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is more than one way to cure a woman of a
heart’s distemper,” said the young man, cheerfully.
“Lady Margaret was just there, behind the curtain.
But this is wasting time. What is your news?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Phipps looked at him in wonder, for a moment, then
shaking his head, sadly, he presently drew his hand
down across his face, to his double chin, as if to wipe
out a smile, which had come out of his eyes and traveled
all over his countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adam,” he said, “they have made me Governor of
the colony, and I want you to go home with me to
Boston.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam said nothing, for a moment, then he answered:
“Let’s get out of this. I want some fresher air to
think it over in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were soon walking out at the gate, arm in arm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>The air was not only fresh, it was bitter cold. When
they turned to go down the street, Adam having first
looked about, without seeing what he sought, old Halberd
issued from a niche, where he had been dancing
to keep himself warm, and followed along behind his
master.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now that you have thought it over,” said
Phipps, at last, “what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam had thought it over, from a thousand standpoints.
The magnet at Boston had drawn him and
drawn him so long that he felt his whole soul was already
across the Atlantic. Why fight his longing any
further? Why not at least go home, look the proposition
in the face and perhaps be disillusionized?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m your man,” he said, as if to catch himself before
he should alter his mind. “When are you sailing?”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>REVELATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>When</span> the Andros government came to an end,
Edward Randolph had languished in jail for a brief time
only. The Puritans were chiefly angered at his master,
whom they had finally put aboard a ship and sent away
from the country. Thus the more mischievous spirit,
and author of many of their wrongs, escaped to work
his malignant will upon them for years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph was so crafty, so insidious, and willing to
remain so in the background, that until it was quite
too late to redeem their position, the Puritans failed
even to suspect him of the monstrous iniquities he induced
them to commit upon one another. The witchcraft
persecutions, which he fastened upon them, had
not originated in his brain, fertile as that organ was
for the growth of things diabolical. He got his cue
from England, where thousands of persons perished,
at the stake and otherwise, convicted on fantastic
testimony of practising arts that were black and
mysterious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph, realizing that Boston had been made too
warm for active operations, began his work in Salem.
That center offered him exceptional opportunities.
The growth of the dread disease was appalling. History
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which would convey an adequate idea of this
criminal fanaticism should be bound in charred human
skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boston was duly afflicted with the scourge. Randolph
then returned, quietly, and so manipulated his
work and his dupes, from behind his own scenes, that
scores of old women were charged with and convicted
of witchcraft, in Randolph’s hope of wreaking his
vengeance thus on whatsoever old woman it might have
been who had told Garde Merrill of his affair with
Hester Hodder. Having never been able to ascertain
that this person was Goody Dune, he was sweeping his
net in all waters, to make sure of his prey, in the same
merciless spirit that Herod slew all the male infants,
to accomplish his terrible purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Governor Phipps, with Adam Rust and Increase
Mather, arrived at Boston, in the frigate “Nonsuch,”
in May, 1692, the prisons were crowded full of witches,
for the smell of whose burning or rotting flesh scores of
fanatical maniacs were clamoring.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Massachusetts had known that William Phipps,
the Governor who had risen so mightily from the ranks
of the working men among them, was coming. The
name of the lane wherein his house had been built
was altered to Charter street, in his honor; the citizens
beat their drums; the disciples of gladness in the
stomach arranged for a banquet; the hordes marched
in joy and with pomp and Puritan splendor, which
lacked nothing in ceremony, as Sir William was conducted
to his house and then to the public dinner.
Even the fanatics waxed enthusiastic and developed
symptoms of being yet more greatly pursued and bewitched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>by the witches whose incarceration they had
already procured.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the madness, confusion and excess of glee, two
persons were more inwardly stirred than all the others,
not by the arrival of William Phipps, but by that of
Adam Rust. One was Garde, to whose ears and heart
the story of Adam’s return came swiftly flying. The
other was Edward Randolph, who saw an opportunity
for deviltry for which he had waited so long that he had
almost despaired of ever tasting its bitter-sweet. With
his own eyes he beheld Adam Rust, and he grinned.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of that long, fatiguing day, Rust retired
to the privacy of his tavern apartments, secured haphazard,
during one of the moments less filled than the
others with pressing events. Here he sat him down
for the purpose of thinking. He wondered why he
had come to Boston again, and what he would do, now
that at last he lived under the same sky with Garde,
hearing the same sounds she was hearing, breathing
the same fragrance of the Spring that stole to her.
Should he try to see her? Perhaps. But to speak to
her—no, he thought he could make no advance in this
direction. But he could learn whether she had married,
as of course she must have done, long before, and
then—well, something in him ought to be satisfied—that
something which had urged him so inexorably to
return and to make this moment possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of his reveries, he heard a knock upon
his door. It was poor old Halberd, doubtless, who had
been so forlorn and so ill on the ocean. He had left
him asleep, but, no matter, he would be glad to see him,
privacy of thought notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>“Come in,” he said. “Come in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The door opened, not as Halberd was wont to perform
an act so simple, and Adam was conscious that a
stranger had intruded upon him. He looked up,
winked his eyes and looked more intently, as if absolutely
incredulous that he was awake and sane.</p>

<p class='c007'>His visitor was Edward Randolph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rust, I am glad to see you again in Boston,”
said the man, coming forward in a tentative manner
and smiling by sheer force of effort. “You didn’t
expect me, but I have taken this early opportunity of
calling, to say I know what a great wrong I did you in
the past, and to make what reparation I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The devil could do no more,” said Adam, looking
him over calmly. “And I doubt if the devil ever had
your impertinence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do me wrong,” Randolph assured him,
meekly. “I could do no less than to come here and
tender what apologies I may, and to do you a small
favor. I was grossly misled, concerning your worth
and your courage, by spiteful persons who had, as I now
understand, some personal grudge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I knew but two men in the town, when first I
had the honor of appraising you for a rascal,” said
Adam, “your tale pleases me but indifferently well.
As for favors, I have none to ask of you, and none to
grant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet, if only in a Christian spirit,” the fellow insisted,
“you must permit me to beg your pardon for
my errors of the past. I have long regretted my grievous
mistake of judgment, and for that long I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>desired an opportunity of showing my mortification
and doing you the one kindness in my power.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the spirit of the Christian crusaders,” said
Rust, “I feel that I could deny you little. You would
do well, sir, to retire in good order while my indisposition
to throw you through the window is still upon
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my dear Mr. Rust, you don’t know what an
injury you are doing to yourself,” the visitor went on.
“If you knew how cruelly we were both wronged,
almost at the same time and by the same person, you
would listen, if only for that one compassion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been wronged in Boston,” Adam agreed,
ominously, “and shatter my hilt if I know why I hesitate
to redress myself while I may.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I did you no wrong to your heart, sir. Our
injuries were both of the heart,” Randolph reiterated,
persistently. “Look, sir, I had a heart, six years ago,
and I felt it cruelly trampled under foot—the same
foot that trampled upon yours, and here——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beware!” Adam growled. “I shall cut out your
tongue, for little more. Begone, sir, and thank your
God at every step you take, that you still live—if you
value your life at all; and this I am driven to doubt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, here!” replied Randolph, nervously, and
with shaking fingers he drew from his pocket a packet
of paper folded in the form of a letter. “You will
never believe me till I show you this. But I lay my
heart open—I expose my wounds, to prove how you
wrong me. Read it, read it—the letter she sent me—and
then I shall be willing to bide by your answer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam could not fail to be impressed by the man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>tenacity of purpose. Being a just man, he had a faint
suspicion dart through his head that, after all, the man
might not have known what he was doing when he
committed all his fiendish acts, years before. There
had never been any sufficient reason for what he had
done, that Adam knew. He took the letter, briefly to
see what it was the fellow meant and wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to read, and then to feel that the man had
obviously undergone some trial, severe and not readily
to be forgotten. It was Garde’s own letter to himself
he was reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She sent me that and then broke my heart after,”
said Randolph, speaking in a low, emotional voice,
while Adam looked at the letter. “As if she had not
shattered my life sufficiently before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry for you,” said Rust, after a moment.
“Here, I don’t care to pry into your letter. Take it,
and go in peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But read it, read it. You don’t know who wrote
it,” said Randolph, who was white with excitement.
“I shouldn’t have come to you here with my mortifying
apologies, if there had not been a bond between
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam gave him a look, as of one baffled by an inscrutable
mystery. He could not comprehend his
visitor’s meaning. Then suddenly a flush leaped into
his face, as he remembered something he had heard in
those by-gone days, when he walked with that youth,
whose very name he could not recall, from Plymouth
to Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>He read the letter again with a new interest, a terrible
interest. He had gone away from Garde—sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>away—with a stab in his heart, from which he had
never been able to recover. He had thought at first
she sent him away as a renegade, a fugitive from
pseudo-justice, whom to have loved openly would be a
disgrace. He had thought then that perhaps she
loved Wainsworth, or even this Randolph. He had
thought till he nearly went crazy, for circumstances
had compelled him to flee from Boston for his life, and
therefore to flee from all explanations which might have
been made. Garde having released him from jail, he had
been driven to think she believed him innocent. She
had said she could do no less. Then he had been left
no belief to stand on but that of her loving some one
else more than she did himself. She had admitted
that something had happened. Cornered thus, he had
found the case hopeless, and thoughts of return to
Boston then had seemed to him madness.</p>

<p class='c007'>This letter, now in his hand, confirmed all those
more terrible thoughts and beliefs. She had done some
wrong to Randolph, too, as she here confessed in her
letter. She had believed some infamous story against
him, and now prayed his forgiveness. And what, in
God’s name, had she then added to this first wrong to
the man, that Randolph now was so bitter?</p>

<p class='c007'>Terribly stirred, he raced his glance over the pages
and so to the little quaintly affectionate ending. Then
he read her signature, “Garde—John Rosella.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John Rosella!—the name of that youth! She!
Garde!</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt he should suddenly go mad. That boy he had
so learned to love—had been Garde! She had written
this letter—she had signed that name, which meant so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>much to him and to her, and so little to any one
else!</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a strange little sound, and then he began
to read the letter over again, from the first, letting
every word, every syllable, sink into his soul with its
comfort and its fragrance of love. He forgot that
Randolph stood there before him. He was oblivious
of everything. He was on that highroad again. He
was standing with Garde in the garden at midnight,
her kisses still warm on his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see there is a bond between us,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam ceased reading, galvanically. But for a
second he did not raise his eyes. He folded the letter
and held it in his hand. He arose to his feet and
slowly moved between Randolph and the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a bond between us,” he agreed, speaking
with nice deliberation. “It is something more than
a bond. It’s a tie of blood and bone and suffering.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you would see it,” said Randolph.
“This was all I came to tell you,—this, and my sense of
having done you wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes, I see it,” said Adam, turning the key in the
lock and putting it calmly in his pocket, “I see it all
clearly. By the way, sir, who is John Rosella, if I may
ask?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph had become pale. His eyes were growing
wild. He had watched Rust lock the door with quaking
dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Rosella?” he repeated, with a sickening
sense of having overlooked something important, which
he had thought an insignificant trifle; “why, that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>merely the—her middle names. Her full name is
Garde John Rosella Merrill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust you are gentleman enough to fight,” said
Rust, placing the letter in his pocket, “for I shall tell
you, sir, that you are a liar, a scoundrel, a murderous
blackguard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking up to the staring wretch, calmly, Adam
slapped his face till the blow resounded in the room
and Halberd came hastening to the door to know what
could be the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rang the bell,” said Rust, who opened the door
with great deliberation. “Bring a sword for one.
The gentleman wishes to fight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean, sir?” said the trembling
coward. “Give me back my letter. I shall leave
this place at once!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you jump through the window?” Adam
inquired, with mock concern. “Don’t call that letter
yours again, or I may not let you off with a mere
killing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Halberd came with his sword. Adam drew his own
good blade from the battered scabbard he had always
retained, and looked at the edge and the point, critically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I refuse to fight you!” said Randolph, who had
once seen that terrible length of steel at play. “I
demand to be released from this place!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rust went up and slapped him again. “Get up just
manhood enough to raise that sword,” Adam implored.
“Take it and strike any sort of a foul blow at me—one
of your foulest—do! you dog.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The craven tried to make a run at the door. Adam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>pushed him back and kicked him again toward the
center of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is murder! I refuse to fight with such a
villain!” cried the fellow. “Let me out, or I shall
call for help.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wouldn’t dare to let anybody know you are in
town,” said Rust, contemptuously. “Howl, do howl,
and let me tell the public what you are. Halberd,
alas, there is no manhood in it. Therefore fetch me
the whip I saw in your apartments, for a sad bit of
business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To all of Randolph’s protests and wild chatterings
of fear and hatred, Rust was deaf. He took the whip,
which Halberd presently brought, and proceeded to cut
Randolph across the face, the legs, the shoulders and
the hands till the craven smarted with a score of
purple welts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halberd, you may clean your boots afterward,”
Adam said at last. “Be good enough to kick the dog
from the room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Halberd placed but two of his aids to departure, and
then, Rust opening the door, the craven flew madly
out and away, a maniac in appearance, an assassin in
his state of mind.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>AFTER SIX YEARS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>At</span> Grandther Donner’s house, Garde had passed
the day with her heart so fluttering between hope and
fear that she was all unstrung by the time the evening
arrived. She could bear it no longer, then, and with
a shawl on her head she started out to go to the Soams’
to learn what she might of the many events of the
hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the garden she paused. The stillness, the calm,
the redolence of Spring, burgeoning into maidenly
summer, brought back to her mind that similar time,
six long years before, when she and Adam had met
here among the flowers, for that brief time of joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fire of love, kept so sacred by the vestal virgin
spirit of her nature, burned upward in her cheeks, as
warm, as ardent as ever, after these years of her lonely
vigil.</p>

<p class='c007'>But would he ever stand there again, in the garden?
Would he ever more clasp her hands on the pickets of
the gate? Or would he now prove disdainful, proud
of his friendship with the new Governor, aloof and
silent, as he had been since she sent him her letter?</p>

<p class='c007'>No matter what might be, she so hungered to hear
some word of his coming, some meager description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>how he looked, some mere hearsay of how he bore
himself, that it seemed as if she must consume herself
with impatience on her way to her uncle’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dusk which was swiftly descending on the
face of the world, she closed the gate behind her and
started along the road, her face so pale and yet so
eager, in her yearning, that it was almost luminous.
She was presently conscious that some one, dimly visible,
ahead, was rapidly approaching. She drew her
shawl a little more closely about her face and quickened
her footsteps, the sooner to pass this pedestrian.</p>

<p class='c007'>A metallic tinkle came to her ears and made her
heart give an extra bound, she knew not why. It had
simply sounded like a scabbard, beating its small
accompaniment to sturdy strides. She looked up,
timidly, to see who it was that carried a sword into
such a quiet part of Boston. Then she halted and
suddenly placed her hand out, to the near-by fence,
for a moment’s support.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man was almost passing her by, where she stood.
He halted. He made some odd little sound, and then
he remained there, looking upon her, his hand coming
involuntarily up to his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde looked up in his face, without fear, but not
without sadness, wistfully—with the inquiry of six long
years in her steadfast eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Garde,” said Adam, in a voice she barely heard,
“Garde—I have—come home. I never got your letter
till to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She could not answer, for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—have been waiting,” she then said, and striving
to hold her lips from trembling, she let two great tears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>trickle slowly across her face as she still looked up in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing he could say. He read her whole
story of faithfulness and of suffering, her epic of a love
that could not die, in that one long look. Slowly he
went up to her and taking her face in his hands he
kissed away the tears from her cheeks. He put her
head gently against his breast and let her cry.</p>

<p class='c007'>She still held to the fence, as if she dared not too
suddenly lean on his love, without which she had
learned to live so long. But gradually, as he held her
there, saying nothing, but softly kissing her hair and the
one little hand he had taken in his own, her arms crept
upward about his shoulders and her heart beat against
his, in a peace surpassing anything of earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Garde,” he finally began to whisper, over and
over again, “my own Garde—my darling, precious
Garde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, this may all be wrong, Adam,” she answered
him, after a time. “I don’t understand it. We don’t
know what has happened, in all these years. Oh, how
did you happen to come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You drew me, sweetheart,” he said, in a voice
made tremulous with emotion. “I have had no peace
till now. I have loved you so! I have dreamed of
you so! But I never knew—till to-night, when I got
your letter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—never got it till to-night? Oh Adam,” she
said. “Oh, Adam, I have been so punished for the
wrong I did. Oh, you can never, never forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there, sweetheart,” he said to her soothingly,
letting her cry out the sobs she had stifled so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>vainly. “Forgive you, dear? You had no need to
ask for forgiveness—you who came to me there in that
jail—you, whose sweet little motherly spirit so provided
for my poor old beef-eaters, when they were hungry
and fleeing for their lives. Dearest, I don’t see how
you did it, when I was a hunted renegade, a fugitive,
with doubled infamies piled upon my head. Oh,
forgive me, dear, that ever I doubted my own little
mate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I should never have believed them—not all
the world!” she protested. “My Adam. My
Adam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his strong arm about her, and her head leaned
in confidence and love on his shoulder, he led her
back to the garden, at once the scene of their joys and
tragedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>He enthroned her on the steps of the porch, where
as a child she had been enthroned, when he as her boy-lover
had sat, as now, at her feet and listened to the
dainty caresses of her voice. Only now he held her
hand in his and placed it on his cheek and kissed it
fondly, as he listened and told her of how he had come
at last to receive the letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this she was frightened. She wanted to cradle
his head upon her bosom, now, and hold forth a hand
to shield him from danger. She felt that the perils for
them both were clustered about his fearless head and
that hers was the right to protect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, please be careful, Adam, dear,” she implored.
“That man is a terrible man. Oh, I wish you had let
him go. You will be careful, dear. You must be
careful, and watchful, every moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>His reply was a kiss and a boyish laugh. Now that
he had her once more, he said, and now that nothing
should ever part them again, his world was complete,
and there were no dangers, nor evils, nor sorrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he begged her to tell him of the years that had
passed. He petted her fondly, as she spoke of her
long, long wait. She seemed to him thrice more
beautiful, in the calm and dignity of her womanhood,
which had laid not so much as a faded petal on her
beauty and her endless youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>He exchanged a history of heart-aches, matching
with one of his own every pang she had ever endured.
There was something ecstatic, now, in the light of
their new-found rapture, in recounting those long days
of sadness and despair. Every pain thus rehearsed
drew them the closer, till their love took on a sacredness,
as if suffering and constancy had wedded them long
before. Like parents who have buried the children
they loved, they were made subdued and yet more
truly fervent, more absolute in the divine passion which
held them heart to heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so, at last, when Garde was sure that Adam ought
to go, they walked hand in hand to the gate together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sweetheart, let me go outside, for a moment,” said
Adam, quickly shutting the barrier between them.
“Now, with your two dear hands in mine, it is just as
it was six years ago. The night is the same, your
beauty is the same, our hearts and love are the same as
before, and nothing has ever come between us—except
this gate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He kissed her hands and her sweet face, as he had
done on that other happy night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>“And we can open the gate,” said Garde, in a little
croon of delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam laughed, like the boy he was. He flung open
the gate and went inside and took her in his arms,
kissing her upon the lips, rapturously, time after time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh Garde, I love you so!” he said. “I love you!
I adore you, my own little mate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could have waited fifty years,” she answered him,
nestling close and patting his hand as she held it, in
excess of joy, to her heart. “Oh Adam! My Adam!”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>A BLOW IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> rover, so lost in exalted happiness that he hardly
knew where he was going, when at length he said his
final good night to Garde, was not aware that the faithful
old Halberd finally fell into his tracks behind him
and followed him off toward the tavern.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immensely relieved again to see his master, whom
he had not been able to locate before, the old beef-eater
was soon convinced that Adam was in a mood the
like of which had not appeared in the family for many
a day. He therefore glided silently after the dreamer,
a rod or so to the rear, waiting until Adam should turn
about, as was his wont, to bid him walk at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to-night the Sachem was so thoroughly engrossed
with his love and his forming plans, that he completely
forgot to think of his lorn retinue, and therefore the
beef-eater felt more alone and sad than usual. There
was nothing in Boston, save Adam, with which he
could associate any thoughts of jollier days. There
was nothing but Adam left in the world, to which to
devote the great fund of affection and devotion in his
simple breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was making no complaint, not even to himself.
Whatever the Sachem did was right. Nothing
that Adam could have done would have driven him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>away, nor have altered his love by so much as one jot.
All he desired was the privilege of loving his master,
at whose heels he would have followed, though the
path led to Hell itself, and this with never so much as
a question, nor a murmur of hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moon had been silvering the roofs of the houses
for some time, and Adam and Halberd wended their
way, in their short procession, through the deserted
business streets of the town. Masses of shadow lay
upon the sidewalk, where Adam was striding buoyantly
along.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within fifteen feet of him, and between him and
Adam, suddenly Halberd heard a sound that made him
halt where he stood. Three figures, their faces masked
with black cloth, ran out from a deep doorway, where
they had crowded back, for concealment, and darted
upon the rover, walking unconsciously onward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sachem! Sachem!” cried the beef-eater, wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He darted forward, in time to see Adam turn to receive
a stab in the neck and a blow on the head that
sent him to earth before he could even so much as
raise a hand to ward off his murderous assailants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dragging his sword from his scabbard as he ran, old
Halberd leaped frantically into the midst of the three
asassins, ready to battle against any odds conceivable,
in this the climax-moment of his loyalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>He struck but a single blow, which fell upon one of
the bludgeons held by the masked ruffians. He
screamed out his terrible tocsin of anguish and rage.
Then a blow from behind him crushed in his skull and
he fell across the master he had striven to serve, a
corpse.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Waiting for nothing further, the three figures sped
away, down the street, dived into the darkness of an
alley and were gone, past all finding, when a few startled
citizens opened their windows or doors and looked
out on the street to see what the awful cries of Halberd
had betokened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see something—down on the sidewalk,” said the
voice of one of the men. “The lantern, wife, the
lantern!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it? What is it?” called another, from
across the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>And others answering, that they knew not what it
meant, or that it had sounded like some terrible deed
being done, there were presently half a dozen awed
men coming forth, when their neighbor appeared at his
door with his light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The black, still heap which had been seen from a
window smote them all with horror. A dark stream,
from which the light was suggestively reflected, already
trickled to the gutter. They lifted Halberd from the
second prostrate form and found that Adam was
swiftly bleeding to death from a ghastly wound in the
neck, from which the life-fluid was leaping out in
gushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn him over, turn him over!” commanded
the man with the lantern. “Run to my house and
ask the wife for everything to tie up an artery—bandages,
too!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He knelt down in the red stream. Digging his
fingers into the gaping, red mouth of the wound, he
clutched upon the severed artery with a skill at once
brutal and sure. The gushes ceased, almost entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Adam’s face, already deathly white, had been turned
upward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saints preserve us!” said one of the citizens.
“It’s the bosom friend of the Governor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we know where to take him, if he doesn’t
die in spite of me,” said the skilful surgeon who had
pounced upon the wound. “Look to the other man
and see if he too, is bleeding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the other men had already loosened the collar
about old Halberd’s neck. Another came to assist
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s bleeding a little, from the back of his head,”
said he. “O Lord! He’s dead!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor’s wife came running to the place herself,
with her husband’s case in which he had a score of
cunning tools and the needs of his craft.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good woman pushed the men aside and with an
assurance and a courage almost totally unknown in her
sex, at the time, in such a case as this, bent down
above the wounded man and lent to her husband the
nimble fingers and the quick comprehension without
which he might easily have failed to prevent that
deadly loss of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was, Rust was at the door of death. The turn
he had made, when Halberd called out in alarm, had
saved him from inevitable death. The steel driven so
viciously into his neck, would have severed the jugular
vein completely had he turned the fraction of a
second less soon than he did, or an inch less far.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blow on his temple had glanced, so that half
the power, which in the case of Halberd had crushed
in the skull instantly, had been lost, nevertheless it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>had served to render him wholly unconscious. Therefore,
two hours later, when brave little Mrs. Phipps
got him laid in a clean, sweet couch, he looked like
death, and his heart-beat was feeble and faintly fluttering
between mere life and the Great Stillness.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>ADAM’S NURSE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>When</span> the intelligence of the almost unparalleled
crime spread with terror and awe in its wake through
Boston, in the morning, Garde heard it like a knell—a
fatality almost to have been expected, when she
and Adam had been at last so happy. She did not
faint. Not even a moan escaped her lips. She turned
white and remained white.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grandther,” she said to the old man who owed his
restoration to health and almost complete soundness
of mind to her ministrations, “I am betrothed to this
friend of our new Governor’s. I shall go to attend
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She left her grandfather staring at her in wonder,
and with only her shawl on her head, she went to the
“fair brick house” which William Phipps had built
for his wife at the corner of Salem and Charter streets
in the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am betrothed to Adam Rust,” she repeated,
simply. “I have come to attend him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As if poor Garde had not already, in six years of
waiting and hoping and vain regrets, sufficiently suffered
for a moment’s lack of faith in her lover, the anguish
now came upon her in a flood tide. Adam no
sooner recovered a heart-beat strong enough to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>promise of renewed steadiness, than he lapsed from his
unconscious condition into one of delirium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had Garde been wholly in ignorance of his past and
his life of many tragedies, she would have been doomed
to learn of all of it now. He lived it all over, a hundred
times, and told of it, brokenly, excitedly, at times
with sallies of witty sentences, but for the most part in
the sighs with which his life had filled his heart to overflowing,
but to which he had never before given utterance.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew now what the boy had suffered when King
Philip, the Sachem of the Wampanoags, was slain,
with the people of his nation. She felt the pangs he
had felt when, on first returning to Boston, he had believed
himself supplanted in Garde’s affections by his
friend Henry Wainsworth. She heard him croon to
the little Narragansett child, as he limped again
through the forest. And then she sounded the depths
of a man’s despair when the whole world and the woman
he loves drive him forth, abased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet much as she suffered with him in this long rehearsal
of his heartaches, there was still one little consolation
to her soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one name only that he spoke, and spoke again
and again, in murmurs of love and in heart-cries of
agony, was—Garde.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having acquired her skill in the harsh school where
her grandfather’s illness had been the master, Garde
could almost have rejoiced in this reparation she was
making to Adam for what she had contributed to his
pangs in the past, had it not been that his hovering so
at the edge of death frightened all other emotions than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>alarm from her breast. Nevertheless she believed he
would live. He could not die, she insisted to herself,
while she gave him a love so vast and so sustaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>This feeling was fairly an instinct. And the truth
in which it was grounded came struggling to the fore,
one morning, when Adam opened his eyes, after his
first refreshing sleep, and laughed at her gayly, if a
little weakly, to see her there, bending down above him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Rosella,” he said, “I have been dreaming
of you—the sweetest boy that ever lived.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Adam,” said Garde, suddenly crimsoning.
“Oh—now you—you mustn’t talk. You must go back
to sleep at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam was drowsy, despite himself. “I remember—every
word—we said,” he murmured, “and every—look
of your sweet—sweet face.” And then he fell
again into peaceful slumber.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived so far as this toward recovery, he made
rapid progress. Healthy and wholesome as he was,
sound, from habits of clean, right living, he mended
almost too fast, according to Garde’s ideas of convalescence,
for she feared he would rise in revolt, over
soon, and do himself an injury by abandoning care
and comfort before she could pronounce him quite
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reality there had been but little more than his loss
of blood to contend with, save that his state of mind
had engendered a fever, as a result of all he had undergone,
so that when this latter was allayed and
the wound in his neck was healing with astonishing
rapidity, his strength came back to his muscles and
limbs by leaps and bounds. Therefore, despite her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>solicitude, Garde was soon happy to see him again on
his feet and making his way about the house, his face
a little wan and white, but the twinkle in his eye as
merry as the light in a jewel.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could furnish no accurate or reliable information
as to whom his murderous assailants had been. He
could only conjecture that Randolph had been at the
bottom of the affair, from motives of vengeance. This
was the truth. But the disappearance of Randolph
from Boston was reckoned so variously, as having taken
place anywhere from two days to three years before,
that nothing could be reliably determined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, it sufficed for Adam and Garde that they
were here, in the land of the living, together, and
though it made the rover feel sad to think of the loss of
his last beef-eater, the faithful old Halberd.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GOODY IN THE TOILS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> worthy Puritan citizens of Boston fêted Governor
Phipps in one breath and asked him to make
concessions of his powers to his council in the next.
They worked themselves weary with enthusiasm over
his advent and then they wore him out with exactions,
with their epidemic of persecuting witches and with
the faults they found with his methods of life and
government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William had not been long in his new harness,
when he was heard to wish he again had his broadax
in hand and were building a ship of less dimensions
than one of state. A little of his old love for his calling
and the men it had gathered about him was expressed
in a dinner which he gave to ship-carpenters, from
whose ranks he was proud to have risen, as he told them
and told the world. He had a hasty temper, as a result
of having been so long a captain on the sea, accustomed
to absolute obedience at the word of command. Yet
his squalls of anger were soon blown over, leaving him
merry, honest and lovable as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately Governor Phipps was largely under
the influence of Increase Mather and his son, the
Reverend Cotton Mather, who were both as mad fanatics
on the topic of religion and witchcraft as one could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>have found in a day’s walk. The influence over
Phipps had been gained by the elder Mather in
England, where he and Sir William were so long associated
in their efforts to right their colony and its
charter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Witchcraft persecutions, having fairly run amuck in
England, Increase Mather had enjoyed exceptional opportunities
for observing the various phenomena developed
by this dreadful disease. He arrived in Boston
after Randolph had succeeded far beyond the dreams
of his own malice in starting the madness on its terrible
career. The field offered an attraction not to be
withstood, by either of the Mathers. They were soon
fairly gorging themselves on the wonders of the invisible
world, testimonies and barbarous punishments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton was an active figure
in all this lamentable business. Phipps was dragged
into the maelstrom bodily. He pitied the frightened
wretches in the prisons and secretly instructed his
jailers to be remiss in their duties of chaining, ironing
and otherwise inflicting needless punishment on these
helpless mortals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more effectually and quietly to turn the fearful
tide, so appallingly engulfing the minds of the
wrought-up populace, Phipps organized a court of
Oyer and Terminer, wherein he sat himself, with seven
magistrates, to try the wretched old women, dragged
screaming to the farcical examinations. At these
trials, devilish children swore away the lives of fellow-creatures,
abandoned alike by their kind and by their
God. In this court of his own making, William Phipps
was slowly and surely putting a stop to the mania, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>the horrors of some of the executions sent a thrill of
fright and dread through the whole of Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exercising his power of pardoning, and then expending
his own money to assist them to flee from the
state, William Phipps saved so many defenseless
women that he fairly broke the fabric of the awful
mania in twain. Early after his arrival, however, he
was called away to Plymouth. No sooner was his back
turned than the zealots pounced, tooth and nail, upon
a new crop of witches and hailed them before the
court, on trial for their lives, in haste before the Governor
should return to work his leniency upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it came about that Garde, having exhausted
the small supply of simples possessed by herself and
Goodwife Phipps, went to Goody Dune’s and there
witnessed the work of a witch-hunting mob.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a warm, summery morning, fit jewel for the
year’s diadem of things beautiful. Cries, yells, of pretended
fear, and harsh, discordant prayers, screamed
into the air, assailed Garde’s ears before she could yet
see the little flower-surrounded hut where Goody lived.
She felt a sudden misgiving strike through her heart
as she hastened onward.</p>

<p class='c007'>She came upon the scene in a moment. Nearly fifty
men and boys, with a sprinkling of mere girls and one
or two women, were storming the small stronghold of
the old wise woman, who had done so much for those
afflicted by ailments and troubles. Indeed in the
crowd there were many citizens who had blessed her
name and the wisdom by which she had mended their
bodily woes. But all now were mad with excitement.
Some were purposely frothing at the mouth. A dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>leaped frantically about, declaring they were being
pinched and bitten by the demons that Goody was
actuating to malice. Young boys slily put nails and
pins in their mouths and then spat them forth, to show
what evils were then and there being perpetrated upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tidy little garden was trampled to pitiable
wreckage of flowers and vines. The house was being
boldly entered by a few lusty knaves, with Psalms
Higgler and Isaiah Pinchbecker in their midst.
Sounds of wild beating, upon the pans and kettles
inside, made half the assembled people turn pale with
self-induced fear, which they loved to experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly Goody’s old black cat came bounding forth.
The men, boys and women fell down in affright,
screaming that the devil was upon them. To add
to their horror and superstitious dismay, the jackdaw,
Rex, came flying out. He perched for a moment on
the ridge and then circled once or twice about the
house. He was wounded, for the ruffians in the cottage
had beaten him savagely, with sticks and whips. He
was bedraggled; for they had thrown water upon him.
His feathers were all awry. He was altogether a sorry
spectacle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“B-u-h-h—it’s cold,” called the bird. “Fools, fools,
fools!” and flapping his ragged wings so that they
clapped against his sides as he flew, he started straight
for the woods and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the witch-hunters had been smitten with delightful
fear before, they were appalled by this terrible
bird. They fell down upon their knees and wept and
prayed and made a thousand and one mysterious signs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>by which evil could be averted. Those who knew in
their hearts that the whole thing, up to this, had been
humbug and fraud, now quaked with a fear that was
genuine. The devil himself had said some horrible,
unthinkable rigmarole which would doubtless cast
a spell upon them such as they would never be rid of
again in their lives. Their children would be born
with fishes’ tails, with asses’ legs, with seven heads.
Above the wails of anguish, which arose on the air,
came the shouts of the captors of Goody Dune. They
were now seen dragging her forth with hooks, which
were supposed to insulate the operator from the evils
which a witch could otherwise pronounce upon her
enemies with dire and withering effect. And then it
was seen what the shouting of triumph was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of the captors bore a Bible in his hand from
which he read, haphazard, at the top of his voice as he
walked, thus disinfecting himself, or fumigating himself,
as it were, to prevent him from catching the evil
which was hovering about the witch, like an aureole of
dangerous microbes of the devil’s own breeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner did old Goody’s well-known form appear
than the fanatics in the garden fled in a panic for the
gate, howling and wailing their prayers more loudly
than before, but pushing and jostling one another and
falling endways, as they tried to run and to look behind
them at the same time. They must see everything,
whatever the cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men were seen to be armed with pitchforks.
There is nothing in the way of a weapon which your
devil so abhors as a pitchfork, in the hands of any one
save himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>This noisy, mad procession moved in great disorder
out into the highway, where Garde had paused, dismayed
and concerned for Goody. She saw the wise
old woman walking calmly along with her captors, for
Goody, unlike the witches of lesser wisdom, knew too
much to cry out wild protests against this infamy, and
so to convict herself of uttering curses, spells and
blasphemies on the public roads. She looked about
her, at men and women she had relieved of pains, and
at children whose early ailments she had exorcised with
her simples.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were all now possessed of the devil, in good
faith, for the mad capers they cut to show that Goody
was all potent to produce the most fiendish and heinous
results upon them could only have been invented out
of the sheer deviltry which is one of the component
parts of the human animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Helpless, terrified by these maniacs about her, Garde
could only lean against the fence and hold her place
while the running, neck-twisting people went by.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, poor dear Goody,” she murmured to herself,
involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old wise woman looked across the bank of bobbing
heads about her and half smiled, in a weary, hopeless
manner that sent a pang straight to Garde’s heart.
She knew that Goody was saying, “Never mind me,
dear,” and this only made it all the more unendurable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goody had been hustled by in a moment. The dust
arose from the scurrying feet. The hobble-de-hoy
pageant went rapidly toward the town, its numbers being
momentarily augumented, as fresh persons heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>disturbance rising and coming near, on the summer
air, and joined the throng.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unwilling to let her friend be conveyed thus away
without her even knowing where she was now to be
taken, Garde followed the last of the stragglers, and so
saw the crowd become a mob, in the more populous
streets of the town, and finally beheld Goody hurried
to one of the prisons and shut out of sight behind the
doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jail was the one into which, six years before,
Adam Rust had been so infamously thrown.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>GARDE’S SUBTERFUGE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Nearly</span> as strong and well as ever, Adam Rust
heard Garde’s excited and desperate tale of Goody’s
capture with an indignation which far outran her own.
He failed to realize, at first, the full import of Goody’s
position. Then, as Garde made him understand the
almost inevitable execution, staring this old woman-friend
in the face, at the end of a trial from which
Truth would fly moaning, with her hands to her ears,
the rover would have buckled on his sword and gone to
batter down the jail to set the old wise woman free,
had his sweetheart not restrained him with all her
powers of dissuasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we have got to be far more clever than that,”
she said. “We have got to get her out of there
quietly—so quietly that we can get her away—a long
way off, before the awful crowds shall find it out.
Help me to do this. Help me to get her out cunningly,
or we shall fail—and to-night it will all be too late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Couldn’t the Governor pardon her out?” said
Adam. “Why has he gone away at such a time?
Here, couldn’t Mrs. Phipps write a pardon? We
could take it to the jailer, and try him. If he then
refused to release our friend, we could try with a little
gold in his hand. Mrs. Phipps—Mrs. Phipps,” he
called to the Captain’s wife.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>The plump little woman would have done anything
on earth for Adam—her boy—and for Garde, whom
she loved no less, but she shook her head at this new
proposal. The potentialities of the position in which
William’s sudden elevation had placed her still gave
her a little fright to contemplate. She knew nothing
of the powers of a Governor, still less of those of a
Governor’s wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would be glad to do this thing, dear Adam,” she
said, “for your sake, or Garde’s, or even for old Goody
herself, but can I? Would I dare? I fear you hardly
know the temper of these people on this question of
witches. They are mad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Try it,” said Adam. “We can do no less than to
give it a trial. The jailer will know of no reason for
limiting the Governor’s prerogatives, nor even those of
his good wife. Write what I shall dictate, and let us
make the attempt. A bit of boldness is often as good
as an army.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Never able to resist when Adam begged or even suggested,
Goodwife Phipps wrote, as he directed, one of
the most sweeping and imperious pardons ever reduced
to cold language. This being duly sanded, and approved,
Rust folded it up and placed it safely in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now then, John Rosella,” he said to Garde, who
blushed prettily, in spite of her many conflicting emotions,
“even supposing this works its charm, we have
only then made a good beginning. I must have a
horse on which to convey old Goody out of the reach
of harm, when they find she has slipped between their
fingers. And the horse must be my own. No more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>borrowed horses will do for me. Therefore content
your mind, sweetheart, while I go forth to make my
needed purchases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He kissed her, while Goodwife Phipps bustled off
importantly about her duties, and reassuring her that
all should yet be well for Goody, he went out into the
glorious sunlight, and felt his old-time vigor spring
forward—from the warmth and the joyousness of
Nature—to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the matter of finding a horse in Boston was not
one to be disposed of lightly. He hunted far and wide,
for of those which were offered for sale, many were
old, a few were lame and others were vicious. These
latter he would have liked, for himself, since they
challenged him, their spirit against his, but foregoing
the pleasant anticipation of a battle royal, he rejected
offers right and left, until he had used up the morning
completely, and at length felt obliged to be satisfied
with a somewhat undersized bay, who nevertheless
seemed strong and otherwise fit for the business in
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde in the meantime had grown nervous with impatience,
afraid as she was, of one of those swift, inhuman
trials of Goody which so often were the subterfuges
of the fanatics for rushing a person pre-condemned,
to the death from which there was no
escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thought the matter over calmly,” said Adam,
who knew nothing of real calmness in a moment of daring,
“and I feel certain we shall double our chances of
success by waiting till dark, or near it, when the jailer
might be persuaded to think we could get her away unnoticed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>noticed by the rabble, and so might consent to
the plan, when otherwise he would think he must
refuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was reason in this, as Garde could see.
Making Adam promise to take a rest, before the time
should be ripe for their enterprise, she went home to
David Donner, to set things to rights, and otherwise
to keep abreast of her little housewifely duties. She
found the old man excited, by a call which had come
for his services, at noon.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the seven magistrates who sat in the court of
Oyer and Terminer, to try the witches, had fallen ill.
David had been requested to assume his place. At
this wholly unexpected news, Garde felt her heart leap
with a sudden rejoicing. If the worst came, Goody
would have at least one friend at the trial, to whose
words of wisdom the Council had so frequently listened.
She ran to the old man and gave him a kiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am so glad, dear Grandther,” she said.
“They know how wise you are and just!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thankee, child, thankee,” said the white-haired
old man, smiling with the pleasure which the whole
transaction had excited in his hungering breast.
“They recognize me—a little—at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet so eager had the girl become, and so frightened
of what the results were almost certain to be, if Goody
ever came to her trial, during the absence of Governor
Phipps, that she and Adam were hastening off to the
jail the moment the twilight began to descend on the
town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jailer Weaver owes me some little favor,” she said
as they came to the place, “and he really owes a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>deal to Goody.” Her voice was shaking, her teeth
felt inclined to chatter, so excited was all this business
making her feel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vivid recollections of those terrible moments in
which she had come to see Mrs. Weaver and then had
hovered about the prison, to liberate Adam, made her
cling to his arm in terror of what they were now about
to attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam himself, wondering if the jailer would by any
chance remember his face, and the break he and the
poor old beef-eaters had made, had the boldness and
the love of adventure come surging up in his heart,
till he petted the hilt of his sword with a clenching
fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>They entered at the door of that portion of the
prison building where the Weavers made their residence,
as this would excite no suspicion on the part
of the few pedestrians in the street. The nature
of their business being partially secret, they chose to
interview the jailer in the room which answered for his
parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver was a man who constantly raised and lowered
his eyebrows—a habit he had gained through years of
alternately scowling at his guests and then looking
puzzled or surprised that, being so innocent as they
always were, they should still be brought to such a
place. He listened to Adam’s flowery and courtly address,
in which he announced the advent of Goody’s
pardon, with at least a hundred of these eyebrow contortions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the Governor never pardons before a trial,”
he said. “Else, how should he know but what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>was pardoning a very guilty person indeed? If he had
pardoned her, or if he will pardon her, after the trial,
I shall be glad to give her freedom, poor soul. But
you see she hasn’t even been tried, and moreover this
pardon comes from the Governor’s good lady.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garde’s heart sank. The man was so unanswerably
logical.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my good man,” said Adam, “I tell you this
would be the Governor’s pleasure. And the Governor
stands in the shoes of the King, in matters of grave
importance. Now call in any one and ask if I am not
the Governor’s friend—his secretary, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know your face,” said Weaver, who remembered
Adam well enough, as a former guest of the house, but
who chose to say nothing on delicate subjects. “I
saw you with Sir William the day he landed. Oh,
aye, you are his friend, I know that well. But——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” Adam interrupted. “Then, the Governor—who
stands, mind you, in the King’s shoes, in
this matter, is away. I, being his friend, for the moment
take his place. Therefore I stand in the King’s
shoes myself, and I desire this woman’s pardon!
Bring forth your ink, and I shall add my signature to
the document, in the King’s name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver was bewildered. This reasoning was as clear
as a bell, yet he knew what the angry mobs would soon
be demanding from his stronghold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but there can be no pardon, as I said, till
after trial,” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What!” said Rust striding back and forth, while
Garde looked on and trembled, “do you refuse to
obey your King?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>“Oh, sir, alas, no,” said the jailer. “But what can
I do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do? Do? My friend, do you value your daily
bread? Do you wish to retain your office? Or shall
the Governor grant your dismissal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was touching the man on a spot where he could
endure no pressure. He quailed, for he found himself
between the devil—as represented by the fanatical
spirit of the mob—and the deep sea into which the loss
of his place would plunge him at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t turn me out!” he begged, convinced
well enough of Adam’s power with the Governor. “I
would do anything to please you, sir, and I have done
much already to please the Governor. I am an old
man, sir, and we have saved nothing, and we know no
other trade, and many people hate us. There would
be no place for me and mine. Do not turn us away
for this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t wish to turn you away,” said Adam. “I
merely ask you to release this woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has never done any harm,” put in Garde.
“She has been very good to your wife and you. Surely
you could spare her this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would, Miss, I would,” said the wretched man.
“I am sick to death of this terrible craze of witches,
but what can I do? If I do not release her, I shall
lose my place and starve. If I do let her go, I shall
have all the mobs down upon me, when they find there
is no witch for trial. How can I show them a paper,
instead of a prisoner? My life might pay the forfeit.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>“Oh, Adam, this is terrible,” said Garde. “What
can we do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After trial, you can surely get her pardoned,” the
man insisted. “You have the power. You can save
her then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, they will never wait!” cried the girl. “They
may try her to-night, and find her guilty and hang her
the first thing in the morning!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver turned pale. He knew that what she said
might in all probability be true.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I cannot give them a bit of paper instead of a
prisoner,” he repeated. “If you will bring me some
one else, who will vouch for the mob’s respect of your
pardon, as you vouch for the Governor——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got to have her,” interrupted Adam. “You
can say she escaped, by her power of witchcraft. Release
her, or look your last on these cheerful walls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but, Adam,” said Garde, “why should we make
such misery and trouble for one person—for two persons,
indeed with Mrs. Weaver—in trying to save
another? I like these good people. They are very
kind to their prisoners. They have spent much of
their own money to give them little comforts. Can we
not think of some other way, as good as this, to get
poor Goody out and do no harm to innocent people?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver was ready to break into tears. He started
to repeat, “Bring me some one to——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Oh, I know! I know what to do!” cried
Garde, interrupting. “All you need is some one else
to blame, when they find she is gone! It would never
be your fault if some one took her place. It would be
a trick on you, when they found it out. I’ll take her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>place. I’ll take her place, because when they find out
they are starting to try only me, they will have to
laugh it off as a joke. And Grandther is one of the
magistrates—appointed to-day—so they will have to
let me go—and Goody will be far away, by then—and
no one will get into trouble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So one could blame me—nor they wouldn’t,” said
Weaver, slowly, “but as for you, Miss——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we can do it!” Garde broke in, a little
wildly. “Oh, hurry! we might he too late. You can
put me wherever Goody is, and I can change clothes
with her, and then, Adam——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but——” started Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let me, dear. I shan’t mind it a bit. And in
the morning it will all be over, and Goody will be safe,
and no one harmed—and there is no other way. And
I want to! Oh, Goody has been like a mother to me!
I must do it. Please don’t say anything more. Mr.
Weaver, take me to Goody now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You brave little woman!” said Adam, his own
courage leaping to greet this intrepid spirit in his
sweetheart. “I believe you can do it! We shall
win!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back as early as you can,” said Garde, on
whom a thought of the lonely part of the business was
suddenly impressed. “It won’t seem long. And
when it is over, I shall feel so glad I could do a little
thing for Goody. We must hurry. Every moment
may be precious!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, lassie——” the jailer tried to insist once more,
“you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please don’t talk any more,” said Garde. “Take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>me to her now. And when somebody looking like me
comes back, let her go out by Mrs. Weaver’s door
with Mr. Rust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the King’s name, no more talk,” interrupted
Adam. Then he turned to Garde. “You won’t be
timid, little mate?” he said. “I shall not be gone
past midnight at the most.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be so glad to think I am leaving Goody in
your strong, dear hands,” said Garde, with a smile of
love in her eyes. “Good-by, dear,—good night, till
the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She kissed him, and smiling at him bravely, followed
the jailer, who saw that his place in the jail depended
now on compliance with Adam’s and Garde’s demand.
The tremulous pressure of her little hand in his remained
with Adam when she had gone. He wondered
if he were doing well, thus to let his sweetheart assume
poor Goody’s place. Then his own boldness of spirit
rebuked him and he laughed at the imaginary scene
of the magistrates, when they should finally discover
their trial to be nothing but a farce.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weaver meantime took a candle in his hand and led
the way down the corridor of the prison. Garde
hesitated when she saw him descending the steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—where is she?” she asked, timidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the dungeon, lass,” said the jailer. “I was
over sorry, but it could not be helped. We are full
everywhere else. But I shall leave you the light, and
anything you like for comfort. Only, if you hear any
one coming, blow out the candle straightway, or I
shall be in a peck of troubles.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Quelling her sense of terror, and thinking of
Goody, alone in that darkness, with such dreadful
fates awaiting her reappearance among the people, she
promised herself again it would soon be over, and so
followed resolutely down into the hole where Adam
had once been locked, in those long-past days of
despair.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE MIDNIGHT TRIAL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Goody Dune</span> was a frightened and pitiable spectacle,
with her age and the terrors of the dungeon and coming
execution upon her. She struggled in an effort to
maintain a show of composure, at sight of Garde and
the jailer. Nevertheless she would not, at first, listen
to a word of the plan of substitution, to get her away
from the prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at last she had fairly overridden Goody’s objections,
and had made her complete the exchange of
garments, Garde kissed her with all the affection of a
daughter, and sent her forth to Adam’s protection.
She then heard the lock in the dungeon-door shoot
squeakingly into place with a little thrill of fear, which
nothing human and womanly could have escaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>She listened to the footfalls receding down the corridor,
and then the utter silence of the place began to
make itself ring in her ears. She looked about her, by
the aid of the flickering light which the tallow dip was
furnishing, at the barren walls, the shadows, and the
heap of straw in the corner. At all this she gave a
little shiver of dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the excitement which had buoyed her up to
make this moment possible escaped from her rapidly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>She began to think how Goody must have felt, till her
moment of deliverance came. Then she thought of
what Adam had endured when, lame, hungry, exhausted
and defamed, he had been thrown with violence into this
horrible hole, from which he could have had no thought
of being rescued.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took the candle in hand and went in search of
the tiny window, down through which she had dropped
him the keys. When she saw it, she gave a little
shudder, to note how small it was, and how it permitted
no light to enter the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning then to a paper, filled with bread and
butter, pie, cake and cold meat, which Weaver had
fetched her, while she and Goody had been exchanging
garments, she tried to eat a little, to occupy her time
and her thoughts. But she could only take a sip of
the milk, which stood beside the paper, and a nibble at
the bread. To eat, while in her present state of mind,
was out of the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stillness seemed to increase. She felt little
creeps of chill running down her shoulders. What a
terrible thing it would be to have no hope of leaving
this fearful cellar! Suppose anything should happen
to Adam, to prevent him from returning! How long
would it be till morning? Surely she must have
been there nearly an hour already. She clasped her
hands, that were cold as ice. She almost wished she
had not tried this solution of the difficulty. Then she
remembered the wise old woman, who had made her
neighbors’ children her own care—as she had no sons
nor daughters of her own—and who had been sister,
mother and friend to Hester Hodder, and guardian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>angel, teacher and kindly spirit over herself. This
made her calmer, for a time, and again courageous.</p>

<p class='c007'>When once more the dread of the place and the
ringing silence and the doubts that seemed to lurk in
the shadows, came stealing back, she thought of Adam,
rehearsing every incident in every time they had ever
met. And thus she lingered long over that walk from
Plymouth to Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of sweet reveries which really did much
to dissipate her qualms and chills, she heard someone
walking heavily along in the corridor above her.
Swiftly calling to mind what the jailer had said about
the light, she blew it out and stood trembling with
nervousness, waiting for the door to open before
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the sounds of heavy boots on the upper floor
presently halted. Then they retreated. She breathed
more freely. And then—she suddenly felt the darkness
all about her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fear that some one had been about to enter had, for
the moment, made her oblivious of the curtain of
gloom which closed in so thickly when she blew out
the candle. Now, when she realized that she could
not again ignite that wick, a horror spread through
her, till she closed her eyes and sank on the floor in
despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time that passed was interminable. She had
not thought of how terrible the dungeon would be
without the candle. She could almost have screamed,
thus to be so deprived of the kindly light which had
made the place comparatively cheerful. But she
pulled up her resolution once again, thinking how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>Goody and Adam had endured nothing but darkness,
and with no hope of succor such as she could see illuminating
her hours of dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Midnight came at last and found Garde unstrung.
When the tramp of many feet rang above her, at last,
she welcomed the thought that some one was near.
She hoped it was morning and that Adam had returned.
But then she heard a jangle of keys, and
footfalls on the steps leading down to where she was,
and her heart stood still.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the natural consternation which the hour, the
darkness and the suspense had brought upon her, she
hastily hid her head and face in Goody’s shawl, and
bending over, to represent the older woman, she
tremblingly saw the door swing open and heard the
jailer command her to come forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>With her heart beating violently and her knees
quaking beneath her, Garde came out, relieved in
some ways to flee from that awful hole of darkness,
but frightened, when she saw the array of stern-faced
men, who had come, as she instantly comprehended,
to take her away to a trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not one among the five or six men that
she knew. She remembered the faces of Pinchbecker
and Higgler, having seen them in the morning, when
Goody was taken, but the others were witnesses that
Randolph had sent from Salem, experts in swearing
away the lives of witches. They too had been present
at the capture of Goody.</p>

<p class='c007'>Undetected as she was, Garde was surrounded by
this sinister group of men, and was marched away,
out of the jail, into the sweet summer’s night air, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>so down a deserted street, to a building she had never
entered before in her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hardly had the prison been left behind when Adam
Rust, swiftly returning, after having readily provided
for the safe escape of Goody Dune, came galloping into
Boston, his brain on fire with a scheme of boldness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had made up his mind to ride straight to the
prison, demand admittance, compel the jailer to deliver
Garde up at once, carry her straight to a parson’s,
marry his sweetheart forthwith, and then take her off
to New Amsterdam. Weaver could blame the rescue
of the witch to him and be welcome. He could even
permit Adam to tie him and gag him, to make the
story more complete, but submit he should, or Rust
would know the reason. His wild ride had begotten
the scheme in his adventure-hungry mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew the residence of the parson who had
married Henry Wainsworth and Prudence Soam, the
week before he and Phipps had returned to Massachusetts,
for Garde had told him all the particulars, time
after time—having marriage in her own sweet thought,
as indeed she should. He therefore went first to this
parson’s, knocked hotly on the door, to get him out
of bed, and bade him be prepared to perform the ceremony
within the hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parson had readily agreed, being a man amenable
to sense and to the luster of gold in the palm, wherefore
Adam had gone swiftly off to work the <i>tour de
force</i> on which all else depended. He arrived at the
jail when Garde had been gone for fifteen minutes.
Here he learned with amazement of the midnight trial
to which she had been so summarily led.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>Trembling like a leaf, Garde was conducted into a
chamber adjoining the room wherein the dread magistrates
were sitting, with their minds already convinced
that this was a case so flagrant that to permit the witch
to live through the night would be to impair the
heavenly heritage of every soul in Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the girl was left, in charge of Gallows and two
other ruffianly brutes, whose immunity from the evil
powers of witches had been thoroughly established in
former cases. In the meantime her accusers had gone
before the magistrates, ahead of herself, to relate the
unspeakable things of which Goody Dune had been
guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shaking, not daring to look up, nor to utter a sound,
Garde had tried to summon the courage to throw off
the whole disguise, laugh at her captors and declare
who she was, but before she should arrive in the presence
of Grandther Donner, who would protect her
and verify her story, at least as to who she was, she could
not possibly make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Terribly wrought upon by the suspense of waiting
to be summoned before that stern tribunal of injustice,
Garde began to think of the anger which these unmirthful
men might show, when she revealed the joke before
their astounded eyes. She swayed, weakly, almost
ready to swoon, so great became her alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>She could hear the high voices of Psalms Higgler
and Isaiah Pinchbecker, penetrating through the door.
They were giving their testimony, in which they had
been so well coached by Edward Randolph, who was
even now in there among the witnesses, disguised, and
keeping as much as possible in the background.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>The door presently opened and Garde was bidden to
enter. Her heart pounded with tumultuous strokes in
her breast. She could barely put one foot before the
other. She caught at the door-frame to prop herself
up as she entered the dimly-lighted, shadow-haunted
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then her gaze leaped swiftly up where the magistrates
were sitting. She saw strangers only—men she
knew in the town, but not David Donner. She felt she
should faint, when one of the men turned about, and
she recognized her grandfather, looking feverish, wild-eyed
and hardly sane. This was why she had not
known him sooner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Grandther!” she suddenly cried. “It’s I!
It’s Garde! Oh, save me! Oh, take me home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She flung off Goody’s shawl, and darting forward ran
to her grandfather’s side and threw her arms like a
child about his neck, where she sobbed hysterically and
laughed and begged him to take her away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court was smitten with astonishment from which
no one could, for the moment, recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph had pressed quickly forward. But he now
retired again into the shadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this? What’s this?” demanded the chief
of the magistrates, sternly. “What business is this?
What does this mean? Where is——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Witchcraft! A young witch! Cheated! We are
cheated! The young witch has cheated us of the old
witch!” cried Pinchbecker, shrilly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child! My child!” said David Donner. “This
is no witch, fellow-magistrates and friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has cheated us of the old witch!” repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Pinchbecker wildly. “She has daily consorted with a
notorious witch. She has aided a witch to escape.
She is a witch herself! We know them thus! She is
a dangerous witch! She is a terrible young witch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How comes this?” said the chief again, excitedly.
His associates also demanded to know how this business
came to be possible, and what was its meaning.
The room was filled with the shrill cries of the men denouncing
Garde more stridently than before, and with
the exclamations of astonishment and shouts to know
what had become of the witch they had come there to try.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all this confusion, Garde was clinging to her
grandfather and begging him to take her home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have the girl stand forth,” commanded the chief
magistrate. “We must know how this business has
happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three of the men laid hold of Garde and took her
from her wondering grandfather’s side. She regained
her composure by making a mighty effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goody Dune was no witch!” she cried. “You all
know what a good, kind woman she has been among
you for years—till this madness came upon us! She
is a good woman—and I love her, for all she has done.
She is not a witch—you know she is not a witch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The witnesses, who knew all the ways in which
witches were to be detected, raised their voices at once,
in protest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Order in the Court!” commanded the magistrate.
“Young woman, have you connived to let this Goody
Dune escape?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She was no witch!” repeated Garde, courageously
now. “I knew you would try to send her to the gallows.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>I knew she was fore-condemned! I could do
no less—and you men could have done no less, had you
been less mad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blasphemy!” cried Higgler. “She is convicted
out of her own mouth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When a witch is young,” cried Pinchbecker, “she
can work ten times more awful evils and arts!”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the magistrates spoke: “No woman ever yet
was beautiful and clever both at one time. If she be
the one, she cannot be the other. This young woman,
being both, is clearly a witch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s a witch—worse than the other!” screamed
another of the witnesses. “Condemn her! Condemn
her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Grandther,” cried Garde, “take me away
from these terrible men!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph now came sneaking forth, out of the
shadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is that same young woman,” he cried, “who
lost the colony its charter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The charter!” screamed David Donner, instantly
a maniac. “The charter! She lost us the charter!
Witch! The charter! Condemn her! Kill her!
The charter! She! She! She! Kill her!—Where
is she? The charter! The charter! The charter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his two bony, palsied hands raised high above
his head, like fearful talons, with his white hair awry
over his brow, with his eyes blazing with maniacal fire,
the old man had suddenly stood up and now he came
staggering forward, screaming in a blood-chilling voice
and making such an apparition of horror that the men
fell backward from his path.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>“Oh Grandther! Grandther!” cried Garde, holding
forth her arms and going toward him, to catch him
as she saw him come stumbling toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Witch!” screamed the old man shrilly. “Kill
her! Kill her! I never coerced her! The charter!
Witch! Witch! The charter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He suddenly choked. He clutched at his heart in a
wild, spasmodic manner, and with froth bursting from
his lips, he fell headlong to the floor and was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has killed him!” cried Higgler. “She has
killed him with her hellish power!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Witch! A murderous young witch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Condemn her! Condemn her!” came in a terrible
chorus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the gallows! Hale her to the gallows!” Randolph
added from the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man called Gallows thought this referred to
him. He grinned. He and the two brutes who had
handled many defenseless witches before, came
toward the girl, who stood as if petrified, her hand
pressed against her heart in dumb anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly the door was thrown open and in there came
Governor Phipps, cane in hand, periwig adjusted, cloak
of office on his shoulders. He was blowing his nose as
he entered, so that no one saw his face plainly, yet all
knew the tall, commanding figure and the dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, a trial, at night, and without me?” he
roared, in a towering rage, which many present had
already learned to fear. “Is this your province, you
magistrates, assembled to deal out justice? Do you
heckle a defenseless woman like this? Disperse!—the
whole of you, instantly. I command it! If you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>condemned, I pardon. The prisoner will leave the
court with me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men, craven that they were, he could deceive,
but Garde knew the voice, the gait, the bearing of her
lover. She sprang to his side with a little cry of
gladness and clung to him wildly, as his strong arm
swung boldly about her waist. She could hardly
more than stand, so tremendous had been the stress of
her fearful emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scorning to expend further scolding or shaming upon
them, and comprehending that delay had no part in
his game, Adam turned his back on the slinking company
and strode away, half supporting Garde, who hung
so limply in his hold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph, baffled, afraid to reveal himself by denouncing
the imposture which he had been only a
second behind Garde in detecting, stole close to his
henchmen and whispered the truth in their ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Higgler and Pinchbecker, conscious of the blood of
Adam on their hands, felt their knees knock suddenly
together. The man must be the very devil himself.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c019'>THE GAUNTLET RUN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>With</span> his bride up behind him on his horse, the
rover spurred swiftly away from the parson’s, still within
the hour, in which he had promised to return to his
wedding. Unafraid of whatsoever the world, before
or behind, might contain, while her lover-husband
lived at her side, Garde felt a sense of exhilaration, at
leaving Boston, such as she had never known in all
her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>With her grandfather dead and Goody no longer at
the little cottage on the skirts of town, she had no
ties remaining, save those at the houses of Soam and
Phipps. And what were these, when weighed in the
balance against Adam Rust—her Adam,—her mighty
lord?</p>

<p class='c007'>Trembling and clinging as she was, he had carried
her off. Gladly she had gone to the parson’s. Her
heart now rejoiced, as he told her that Massachusetts
was behind them forever. For its people, with their
harsh, mirthless lives of austerity and fanaticism, she
had only love enough to give them her pity. But her
life was life indeed, when, ever and anon, Adam halted
the horse, lest she fear a fall, and twisted about to
give her a kiss and a chuckle of love and to tell of the
way he had cheated the mob and the court of their
witches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>“Make no doubt of it, you are a witch—one of
the sweetest, cleverest, bravest, most adorable little
witches that ever lived,” he said, “and I love you and
love you for it, my darling wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had left the town early in the morning. By
break of day they were not so far from Boston as Adam
could have wished. The horse had been wearied by
carrying double, when he conveyed Goody Dune to a
place of safety,—so that the old woman could subsequently
join himself and Garde in New Amsterdam,—and
therefore he had halted the animal humanely,
from time to time, as the load under which the good
beast was now working was not a trifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having avoided the main road, for the greater part
of the remaining hours of darkness, Adam deemed it
safe at last to return to the highway, as he thought it
unlikely they had been pursued under any circumstances.
Thus the sun came up as they were quietly
jogging along toward a copse of trees through which
the road went winding with many an invitation of
beauty to beckon them on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crossing a noisy little brook, the rover permitted the
horse to stop for a drink. Not to be wasting the precious
time, Adam turned himself half way around in
the saddle, as he had done so frequently before, and
gave his bride a fair morning salute.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had then barely ridden the horse a rod from the
stream, when, without the slightest warning, the figure
of Gallows, mounted on a great black steed, suddenly
broke from cover among the trees and bore down upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great hulk, sword in hand, made a quick dash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>toward the defenceless two, and slashed at Garde with
all his fearful might.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jerking his horse nearly out of the road, Adam
swung from the line of the brute’s cowardly stroke, yet
before he could do aught to prevent it, Gallows righted,
flung out his leaden fist and dragged the girl fairly off
from her seat, till she struck on the back of her head,
among the rocks of the road, and lay there unconscious,
and almost beneath the tread of the horse’s prancing
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the monster spurred at his horse and turning
him back, rode to drive him madly over the prostrate
form in the dust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making a short, sharp cry of anger, Adam whipped
out his sword and dashed upon the murderous butcher
before he could get within fifteen feet of Garde, where
she lay in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallows had plenty of time to see him coming. The
two met in a tremendous collision of steel on steel
that sounded a clangor through the woods and sent the
two swords flying from their owners’ grips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disarmed, the pair thudded together in a swift and
hot embrace, sawing their horses close in, the more
firmly and straight erect to hold their seats.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You be a fool and I be the fool-killer!” roared
Gallows, hoarsely. He tugged with his giant strength,
to drag Adam fairly across to his own big saddle, where
he could either break his back or beat him to death
with the butt of a pistol, which he was trying to draw
with the hand that held the reins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slipping his wrist under the chin and his hand
around to the fellow’s massive shoulder, Adam tilted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>back the heavy head with a force so great that Gallows
was glad to release his hold, else he would surely have
toppled from his perch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horses leaped a little apart. Back their riders
jerked them. Again the two big human forms shot together,
and clung in a fierce embrace, like two massive
chunks of iron, welded together by their impact. Once
more Gallows used his great brute strength, while
Rust employed his wit and got his same terrible leverage
on the monster’s neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Gallows fought to try to break the
hold, and to drag his opponent headlong from his
horse, by kicking Adam’s animal stoutly in the flank.
But Adam was inflicting such an agony upon him as
he could not endure. They broke away, only to rush
for the third time, back to this giant wrestling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fool will never learn. I shall kill him yet!”
cried Rust to himself, for he went for Gallows’s neck
as before and got it again in his hold.</p>

<p class='c007'>He threw a tremendous strength into the struggle.
Gallows let out a bellow. Releasing the reins, he threw
both his arms about his foe and deliberately fell from
his seat, with the intention of crushing Rust beneath
his weight, on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adam’s turn in the air was the work of the expert
wrestler. The horses shied nervously away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two were up on their feet and telescoped abruptly
in one compact, struggling mass, as if two malleable
statues of heroic size had suddenly been bent
and intertwisted together.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his ox-like force Gallows began to force Adam
backward. Adam let him expend himself in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>manner for a moment. He then discovered the great
hulk’s design. He meant to force the rover to where
Garde was still lying, and so to trample upon her till
the life should be stamped and ground from her helpless
form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randolph had sent him to commit this final infamy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rage that leaped up in Adam’s breast was a terrible
thing. He feinted to drop as if in exhaustion.
Gallows loosened his hold to snatch a better one, at
once. In that second Adam dealt him a blow in the
stomach that all but felled him where he stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before he could straighten to recover, Rust was upon
him like a tiger. Getting around the great brute’s
side, he threw both hands around the short, thick neck
and twisted himself into position so that he and Gallows
were placed nearly back to back. Then with one
movement he lifted at the man’s whole weight, with
the monster’s head as a lever, hauled fiercely backward.
Into the action he threw such a mighty rush of strength
that Gallows was hoisted bodily off the ground, for a
second, and then his neck gave forth a tremendous snap
and was broken so fearfully that one of the jagged ends
of a vertebra stabbed outward through the flesh, and
dripped with red.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole dead weight of the fellow’s carcass rested
for a second on Rust’s back and shoulder, and then
Adam let him fall to the ground, where, like a slain
hog, he rolled heavily over and moved no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Panting, fierce-eyed, ready to slay him again, Adam
stood above the body for a moment, his jaws set, his
fists clenched hard in the rage still upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he heard a little moan, and turning about saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>Garde, attempting to raise herself upward, in the road.
He ran to her instantly and propped her up on his
knee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest, dearest,” he said, “are you badly hurt?
Garde, let me help you. Don’t look—don’t look
there. It’s all right. Here, let me get you back to
the shade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took her up tenderly in his arms and carried her
out of the road to a near-by bank of moss. Here he
sat her down, with her back to a tree, and ran to fill
his hat with water from the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two horses, having stopped to take a supplementary
drink, and a nibble at the grass, were easily caught.
The rover secured them both and tied them quickly to
a bush, with the dragging reins. Then back to Garde
he ran with the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you, dear,” she said, “I don’t think I
am hurt. But with the fright, and the fall, I think
I must have fainted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank God!” said Adam, as she drank from his
hat and smiled in his face, a little faintly, but with an
infinite love in her two brown eyes. “Thank God,
for this delivery. There will be no more trouble. I
feel it! I know it. At last we have run the gauntlet.”</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> his tidy little house in New Amsterdam, Adam
sat reading a letter from Governor William Phipps,
written at Boston.</p>

<p class='c025'>“I forgyve you y<sup>r</sup> merrie empersonashun and all ye

French, where they do threat to harasse our peeple as

<p class='c023'>Adam halted here and looked up at the battered old
sword on the wall. His thought went truant, to his
helpmate, away for a few minutes’ walk to Goody
Dune’s. He shook his head at the Governor’s generous
offer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well, William,” he said aloud, “I don’t know.
I don’t know what may be the matter, but—no more
fighting for me, old comrade. I think it must be that
I—am bewitched.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
